The generalisability of these reports is limited by their design and scale. This study aimed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation improved IBS symptoms in a UK community setting.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants were recruited from the community in winter months between December 2017 and March 2019. 135 participants received either vitamin D (3,000\u00a0IU p.d.) or placebo for 12\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in IBS symptom severity; secondary outcomes included change in IBS-related quality of life.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe participants were analysed on an intent-to-treat basis. 60% of participants were vitamin D deficient or insufficient at baseline. Although vitamin D levels increased in the intervention arm relative to placebo (45.1\u2009\u00b1\u200932.88\u00a0nmol/L vs 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u200926.15\u00a0nmol/L; p\u2009<\u20090.001).

No trials or epidemiology studies to date have investigated a link with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A single case report has suggested a benefit in IBS of vitamin D supplementation. We hypothesised that IBS participants with vitamin D insufficiency would benefit from repletion in terms of their IBS symptoms. We undertook a pilot trial to provide data to support a power calculation and to justify a full trial.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a randomised, double blinded, three-arm parallel design trial of vitamin D, placebo or a combination of vitamin D and probiotics. Participants were further stratified according to whether they were vitamin D replete or insufficient. Vitamin D status was determined by blood test at baseline and exit; IBS symptoms were assessed by validated questionnaire; dietary intakes were assessed by food frequency questionnaire.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA significant proportion of the IBS population were vitamin D deficient, such that the replete stratum could not be adequately recruited. There was a significant association in the baseline data between circulating vitamin D level and quality of life (\"How much has IBS affected your life?\"). Supplementation significantly improved vitamin D level versus placebo. IBS symptoms were not significantly improved in this pilot, although a power calculation was enabled from the intervention data.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe IBS population exhibits significant levels of vitamin D insufficiency and would benefit from screening and possible supplementation. The impact of IBS on quality of life may be reduced by vitamin D level. Future trials should have a sample size of over 97.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\n\n\nICTRN 6116003917.",

I read a study awhile back, that concluded that those of us on Gilenya might not be so fortunate when it comes to antibodies. So, I asked my doctor (not a neuro) should I check mine. She said that the national health bureau (in Finland) doesnt recommend that but she put the request in the system, if I want to go for the blood test. But is it beneficial? Does it actually matter, if Im already masking and socially distancing? Have you guys checked your antibody - levels and has that actually lead to anything? ",

This study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of GG in individuals with moderate to very high risk of SARS-CoV-2.  Methods  A multicenter, controlled, quasi-experimental, before-and-after study was conducted on individuals at moderate to very high risk of SARS-COV-2 exposure. In the intervention group ( n \u202f=\u202f15,992), participants received GG 1\u202fg daily for 28 days in conjunction with standard preventive guidelines (SPG), while in the control group ( n \u202f=\u202f4953), participants were asked to follow SPG only. Outcomes were the incidence of COVID-19, perceived immune status, quality of life, and safety. The perceived immune status was assessed using a brief Likert-scale questionnaire having common immune-related complaints.  Results  Of the 20,945 enrolled, 20,574 completed the trial (intervention: 15,729, control: 4845). The percentage of participants who reported the incidence of COVID-19 was marginally lower in the GG+SPG group (41, 0.26%) than in the SPG group (16, 0.33%), leading to 21% (95% CI, -40% to 55%) efficacy of GG. However, the decrease in incidence percentage was statistically insignificant due to the trivial incidences reported. The scores of perceived immune status quality of life improved significantly from baseline in the GG+SPG group ( p \u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to the SPG group.  Conclusion  GG is safe and improves perception of immune status in individuals at risk of developing SRAS-CoV-2. However, these findings are inadequate to establish that GG lowers the incidence of COVID-19 necessitating to conduct RCTs in high-risk populations.

Participants were enrolled to receive one of three doses of COVID-HIGIV (100, 200, 400\u2009mg/kg) or placebo in a 2:2:2:1 randomization scheme. Between 24 December 2020 and 27 July 2021, 28 participants met eligibility and were randomized with 27 of these 28 (96.4%) being administered either COVID-HIGIV ( n \u2009=\u200923) or placebo ( n \u2009=\u20094). Only one SAE was observed, and it occurred in the placebo group. A total of 18 out of 27 participants (66.7%) reported 50 adverse events (AEs) overall. All COVID-HIGIV-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and transient. The most frequent AEs (>5% of participants) reported in the safety population were headache ( n \u2009=\u20096, 22.2%), chills ( n \u2009=\u20093, 11.1%), increased bilirubin ( n \u2009=\u20092, 7.4%), muscle spasms ( n \u2009=\u20092, 7.4%), seasonal allergies ( n \u2009=\u20092, 7.4%), pyrexia ( n \u2009=\u20092, 7.4%), and oropharyngeal pain ( n \u2009=\u20092, 7.4%).

The study aimed to determine the efficacy of the \"AYURAKSHA\" kit in terms of post-interventional percentage of COVID-19 IgG positivity, immunity levels, and quality of life (QoL) against COVID-19.\nMethod\n\n\nThis was a non-randomized controlled, prospective intervention trial, done after the distribution of 80,000 AYURAKSHA kits (constituent of Sanshamani Vati, AYUSH Kadha, and Anu Taila) among Delhi police participants in India. Among 47,827 participants, the trial group ( n  = 101) was evaluated with the positivity percentage of IgG COVID-19 and Immune Status Questionnaire (ISQ) scores as a primary outcome and the WHO Quality of Life Brief Version (QOL BREF) scores along with hematological parameters as a secondary outcome in comparison to the control group ( n  = 71).\nResults\n\n\nThe data showed that the percentage of COVID-19 IgG positivity was significantly lower in the trial group (17.5 %) as compared to the control group (39.4 %,  p  = 0.003), indicating the lower risk (55.6%) of COVID-19 infection in the trial group. The decreased incidence (5.05%) and reduced mortality percentage (0.44%) of COVID-19 among Delhi police officers during peak times of the pandemic also corroborate our findings. The ISQ score and WHO-QOL BREF tool analysis showed the improved scores in the trial group when compared with the controls. Furthermore, no dysregulated blood profile and no increase in inflammation markers like C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were observed in the trial group. However, significantly enhanced ( p  = 0.027) IL-6 levels and random blood sugar levels were found in the control group ( p  = 0.032), compared to a trial group ( p  = 0.165) post-intervention. Importantly, the control group showed more significant ( p  = 0.0001) decline in lymphocyte subsets CD3 +  (% change = 21.04), CD4 +  (% change = 20.34) and CD8 +  (% change = 21.54) levels than in trial group, confirming more severity of COVID-19 infection in the control group.\nConclusion\n\n\nThe AYURAKSHA kit is associated with reduced COVID-19 positivity and with a better quality of life among the trial group. Hence, the study encourages in-depth research and future integration of traditional medicines for the prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nClinical trial registration\n\n\nhttp://ctri.nic.in/, identifier: CTRI/2020/05/025171.",

        "a6_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nIn a 2012 Phase II clinical trial, 300 Bangladeshi children aged 24 to 59 months with no prior influenza vaccine exposure were randomized to receive a single intranasally-administered dose of either trivalent, Russian-backbone, live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or placebo. Protocol-defined analyses, presented in the companion manuscript, demonstrate decreased viral detection and immunogenicity for A/H1N1pdm09, relative to the A/H3N2 and B strains. This post hoc analysis of the trial data aims to investigate the LAIV strain differences by testing the hypothesis that preexisting humoral and mucosal immunity may influence viral recovery and immune responses after LAIV receipt.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe used logistic regressions to evaluate the relations between markers of preexisting immunity (ie, hemagglutination inhibition [HAI], microneutralization, and immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A (both serum and mucosal antibodies) and LAIV viral recovery in the week post-vaccination. We then tested for potential effect modification by baseline HAI titers (ie, <10 versus \u226510) and week 1 viral recovery on the LAIV-induced serum and mucosal immune responses, measured between days 0 and 21 post-vaccination.\nRESULTS\n\n\nHigher levels of preexisting immunity to influenza A/H3N2 and B were strongly associated with strain-specific prevention of viral shedding upon LAIV receipt. While evidence of LAIV immunogenicity was observed for all 3 strains, the magnitudes of immune responses were most pronounced in children with no evidence of preexisting HAI and in those with detectable virus.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe results provide evidence for a bidirectional association between viral replication and immunity, and underscore the importance of accounting for preexisting immunity when evaluating virologic and immunologic responses to LAIVs.\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION\n\n\nNCT01625689.",

This substudy from the phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled BLISS-76 trial evaluated the effects of belimumab on preexisting antibody levels against pneumococcal, tetanus, and influenza antigens in patients with SLE.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn BLISS-76, patients with autoantibody-positive, active SLE were treated with placebo or belimumab 1 or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 28 days and every 28 days thereafter, plus standard SLE therapy, for 76 weeks. This analysis included a subset of patients who had received pneumococcal or tetanus vaccine within 5 years or influenza vaccine within 1 year of study participation. Antibodies to vaccine antigens were tested at baseline and Week 52, and percentage changes in antibody levels from baseline and proportions of patients maintaining levels at Week 52 were assessed. Antibody titers were also assessed in a small number of patients vaccinated during the study.\nRESULTS\n\n\nConsistent with preservation of the memory B cell compartment with belimumab treatment, the proportions of patients maintaining antibody responses to pneumococcal, tetanus, and influenza antigens were not reduced. In a small group receiving influenza vaccine on study, antibody responses were frequently lower with belimumab, although titer levels were > 1:10 in all patients treated with 10 mg/kg and in the majority treated with 1 mg/kg.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nTreatment with belimumab did not affect the ability of patients with SLE to maintain antibody titers to previous pneumococcal, tetanus, and influenza immunizations.

In addition, interest in natural compounds capable of improving host immunity has increased. This study aimed to examine the effect of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) on virus-specific antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination. We conducted a 24 week clinical pilot study of 350 healthy subjects who received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and a booster vaccination (third dose). These subjects were randomized 1:2 to the KRG and control groups. We evaluated antibody response five times: just before the second dose (baseline), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks after the second dose, and 4 weeks after the third dose. The primary endpoints were changes in COVID-19 spike antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers. The antibody formation rate of the KRG group was sustained higher than that of the control group for 12 weeks after the second dose. This trend was prominently observed in those above 50 years old. We found that KRG can help to increase and maintain vaccine response, highlighting that KRG could potentially be used as an immunomodulator with COVID-19 vaccines.",

Methods:  Safety and tolerability of once-daily plecanatide 6\u2009mg for up to 53 weeks was assessed in patients with IBS-C who either had been enrolled in one of the phase 3 studies or were study-na\u00efve but met eligibility criteria of the double-blind studies. Safety was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Patient-reported questionnaires assessed overall IBS symptoms, treatment satisfaction, and desire for treatment continuation. No dose adjustments or treatment interruptions were permitted during the study. Results:  Of the 2272 patients enrolled, 1842 (81.1%) completed the study. AEs were experienced by 27.3%, and 4.3% discontinued due to an AE. Most AEs were mild or moderate (90.3%). The incidence of diarrhea, the most commonly reported AE, was low (6.7%), and declined in frequency over time. Diarrhea was the most common cause of AE-related withdrawals (2.7% of patients). At week 53 or end of treatment, 88.2% of patients reported \"significant\" or \"moderate\" relief, 72.4% were \"very\" or \"quite\" satisfied with treatment, and 76.6% were \"very\" or \"quite\" likely to continue treatment. Conclusions:  Plecanatide 6\u2009mg was safe and well tolerated in patients with IBS-C treated for up to 53 weeks, with an overall safety profile similar to the 12-week IBS-C studies. Patients reported high rates of relief and satisfaction with treatment, and interest in continuing therapy. Trial registration:  ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02706483.",

Constipation is the most common adverse event with alosetron treatment. Multiple dosing regimens were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (S3B30040) to determine efficacy, tolerability, and evaluate constipation rate.\nMETHODS\n\n\n705 women with severe d-IBS were randomized to placebo, alosetron 0.5 mg once daily, 1 mg once daily, or 1 mg twice daily for 12 wk. The primary end point was the proportion of week 12 responders (patients with moderate or substantial improvement in IBS symptoms) on the 7-point Likert Global Improvement Scale (GIS). Secondary end points were average rate of adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort, and bowel symptom improvements.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe proportion of GIS responders at week 12 (primary time point) was significantly greater in all alosetron groups compared with placebo (54/176 [30.7%], 90/177 [50.8%], 84/175 [48%], and 76/177 [42.9%] for placebo, 0.5, 1 mg once daily, and 1 mg twice daily alosetron groups, respectively; P< or = 0.02). Results were similar for the average adequate relief rate (treatment effects > or =12%, P< or = 0.038). Bowel symptoms were improved in all alosetron groups. Constipation was the most common adverse event (9%, 16%, and 19% patients in the 0.5 mg, 1 mg once daily, and 1 mg twice daily groups, respectively). One event of intestinal obstruction and one of ischemic colitis occurred in the 0.5 mg group, and one event of fecal impaction occurred in the 1 mg twice-daily group. All were self-limited and resolved without sequelae.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAlosetron 0.5 mg and 1 mg once daily as well as 1 mg twice daily are effective in providing global improvement in IBS symptoms, adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort, and improvement in bowel symptoms in women with severe d-IBS.

They reported GI symptoms daily during baseline (14 days), incremental fiber dosing (6 days), and 2 segments of steady full fiber dose (32 days total).\nRESULTS\n\n\nSeverity of symptoms in all groups was minimal. Adjusting for study segment and day, a greater feeling of fullness in the psyllium group was the only symptom that differed from symptoms in the placebo group. The odds of having greater severity of flatus, belching, fullness, and bloating were 1.2-2.0 times greater in the steady dose segment compared with baseline. There was a positive association between symptom severity and emotional upset. Participants with a greater feeling of fullness or bloating or higher scores for total symptom severity or emotional upset were more likely to withdraw from the study sooner or reduce fiber dose.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nPersons with fecal incontinence experience a variety of GI symptoms over time. Symptom severity and emotional upset appear to influence fiber tolerance and study attrition. Supplements seemed well tolerated.",

Oral glucose-tolerance tests were performed every six months. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. The primary end point was a diagnosis of diabetes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nDiabetes was diagnosed in 69 subjects in the intervention group and 70 subjects in the observation group. The annualized rate of progression to diabetes was 15.1 percent in the intervention group and 14.6 percent in the observation group. The cumulative incidence of diabetes was similar in the two groups (relative risk in the intervention group as compared with the observation group, 0.96). Most subjects in whom diabetes developed were asymptomatic. Progression to diabetes occurred at a faster rate among subjects with abnormal base-line glucose tolerance (22 percent per year) than among those with normal base-line glucose tolerance (10 percent per year, P<0.001). There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia. The incidence of chemical hypoglycemia, assessed without ascertainment bias, was similar in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn persons at high risk for diabetes, insulin at the dosage used in this study does not delay or prevent type 1 diabetes.",

Five were treated with subcutaneous insulin: 0.1 IU/kg body weight/day of neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin once a day. Five declined treatment and were used as controls. Control and treatment groups did not differ in terms of age, ICA, insulin autoantibodies (IAA), glutamic acid dehydrogenase (GAD) and FPIR.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThree out of five subjects in both groups developed Type 1 DM during follow-up: after 21, and 32-57 months in the insulin-treated group and after 4, and 18-60 months in the untreated group. Three out of six subjects who developed overt diabetes had a FPIR below the 2nd percentile of the control value at the onset of the study. All subjects who developed diabetes were positive for antibodies to GAD and expressed the HLA-DR3 or DR4 alleles, whereas only one of the non-progressors had these parameters (P < 0.05). During follow-up, a decrease in ICA titres was observed in the group which received prophylactic insulin in contrast with the untreated group. GAD, as well as insulin secretory capacity, remained unchanged in both groups.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe subcutaneous administration of insulin (0.1 IU/kg body weight/day of NPH insulin once a day) in our group of high-risk subjects for Type 1 DM produced only a minor effect in some immunological markers (ICA), without preventing the development of overt disease. The efficacy and safety of insulin used at either a different dose or by a different route, as well as its potential effect in the early phases of prediabetes, warrants further investigation.",

We hypothesized that parents from marginalized backgrounds, youth with higher pre-pandemic A1c and no CGM use, parents with lower pre-pandemic\u00a0social/family support and more pre-pandemic mood/anxiety symptoms, and those with more negative COVID-19 experiences would have more depressive symptoms, fewer positive and more negative diabetes-specific experiences, and more COVID-19-specific distress during the initial months of the pandemic.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\n\n\nParticipants were parents of early school-age children with type 1 diabetes (n\u00a0=\u2009100; 65% non-Hispanic, white, 92% mothers, 75% married; M child age  \u00a0=\u20096.74\u2009\u00b1\u20091.59\u2009years) who had completed a behavioral intervention trial \u22656\u2009months ago and were re-contacted in June/July 2020 to report on their COVID-19 pandemic experiences and parent psychosocial outcomes.

More pre-pandemic depressive symptoms predicted more depressive symptoms during the pandemic. More life disruptions due to the pandemic were associated with more negative diabetes-specific experiences and more COVID-19-specific distress. Parents of color had more negative diabetes-specific experiences.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nSocial support may be particularly important to assess and address through intervention.

        "a5_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nIn recent years different types of immune interventions have been tried at the onset of type 1 diabetes. Although some have shown effects, none have proven to be sufficiently effective to justify the inherent risks and side effects. Antioxidants have no or minimal side effects. If they can protect the beta cells against free oxygen radicals during the inflammatory process this would be a safe and cheap intervention. To evaluate this hypothesis a combination of various antioxidative agents was employed in a double-blind randomized study.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThe study group comprised 46 children aged 1-17 years at diagnosis. They were followed for 3 years: 2 years whilst taking the tablets and 1 year of follow-up. Twenty-four children were randomly allocated to active treatment with high doses of antioxidants and 22 children to placebo tablets. The tablets were the same size and tasted identical.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTwenty patients had for more than 1 month an insulin dose <0.5 U/kg in parallel with a normal HbA(1c) value and stable blood glucose values, but with no difference observed between those with and without active treatment. Nor was any significant difference observed regarding C-peptide values, fasting as well as stimulated. Whilst the antioxidants demonstrated no positive effect, they also had no negative side effects.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAt diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children, high doses of antioxidative agents have no effect either on the preservation of beta cell function or on metabolic balance.",

It is unknown whether treatment with oral insulin can induce a tolerogenic immune response in children genetically susceptible to type 1 diabetes.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo assess the immune responses and adverse events associated with orally administered insulin in autoantibody-negative, genetically at-risk children.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\n\n\nThe Pre-POINT study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 clinical pilot study performed between 2009 and 2013 in Germany, Austria, the United States, and the United Kingdom and enrolling 25 islet autoantibody-negative children aged 2 to 7 years with a family history of type 1 diabetes and susceptible human leukocyte antigen class II genotypes. Follow-up was completed in August 2013.\nINTERVENTIONS\n\n\nChildren were randomized to receive oral insulin (n\u2009=\u200915) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200910) once daily for 3 to 18 months. Nine children received insulin with dose escalations from 2.5 to 7.5 mg (n\u2009=\u20093), 2.5 to 22.5 mg (n\u2009=\u20093), or 7.5 to 67.5 mg (n\u2009=\u20093) after 6 months; 6 children only received doses of 22.5 mg (n\u2009=\u20093) or 67.5 mg (n\u2009=\u20093).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\n\n\nAn immune response to insulin, measured as serum IgG and saliva IgA binding to insulin, and CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses to insulin.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIncreases in IgG binding to insulin, saliva IgA binding to insulin, or CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses to insulin were observed in 2 of 10 (20% [95% CI, 0.1%-45%]) placebo-treated children and in 1 of 6 (16.7% [95% CI, 0.1%-46%]) children treated with 2.5 mg of insulin, 1 of 6 (16.7%[ 95% CI, 0.1%-46%]) treated with 7.5 mg, 2 of 6 (33.3% [95% CI, 0.1%-71%]) treated with 22.5 mg, and 5 of 6 (83.3% [ 95% CI, 53%-99.9%]) treated with 67.5 mg (P\u2009=\u2009.02). Insulin-responsive T cells displayed regulatory T-cell features after oral insulin treatment. No hypoglycemia, IgE responses to insulin, autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase or insulinoma-associated antigen 2, or diabetes were observed. Adverse events were reported in 12 insulin-treated children (67 events) and 10 placebo-treated children (35 events).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\n\n\nIn this pilot study of children at high risk for type 1 diabetes, daily oral administration of 67.5 mg of insulin, compared with placebo, resulted in an immune response without hypoglycemia. These findings support the need for a phase 3 trial to determine whether oral insulin can prevent islet autoimmunity and diabetes in such children.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nisrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN76104595.",

        "a7_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nInsulin resistance increases during adolescence in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), complicating glycemic control and potentially increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Metformin, typically used in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is a possible adjunct therapy in T1DM to help improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nWe hypothesized that metformin would improve metabolic parameters in adolescents with T1DM.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\n\n\nThis randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 74 pubertal adolescents (ages: 13-20 yr) with T1DM. Participants were randomized to receive either metformin or placebo for 6 months. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months, with fasting lipids measured at baseline and 6 months.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTotal daily insulin dose, BMI z-score and waist circumference significantly decreased at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline within the metformin group, even among normal-weight participants. In the placebo group, total insulin dose and systolic blood pressure increased significantly at 3 months and total insulin dose increased significantly at 6 months. No significant change was observed in HbA1c at any time point between metformin and placebo groups or within either group.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nLow-dose metformin likely improves BMI as well as insulin sensitivity in T1DM adolescents, as indicated by a decrease in total daily insulin dose. The decrease in waist circumference indicates that fat distribution is also likely impacted by metformin in T1DM. Further studies with higher metformin doses and more detailed measurements are needed to confirm these results, their underlying mechanisms, and potential impact on CVD in T1DM youth.",

Scores on a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests obtained during the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications follow-up study, approximately 18 years later, were compared with baseline performance. We assessed the effects of the original DCCT treatment group assignment, mean A1C values, and frequency of severe hypoglycemic events on eight domains of cognition.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were a total of 294 reported episodes of coma or seizure. Neither frequency of hypoglycemia nor previous treatment group was associated with decline on any cognitive domain. As in a previous analysis of the entire study cohort, higher A1C values were associated with declines in the psychomotor and mental efficiency domain (P < 0.01); however, the previous finding of improved motor speed with lower A1C values was not replicated in this subgroup analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nDespite relatively high rates of severe hypoglycemia, cognitive function did not decline over an extended period of time in the youngest cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes.",

Here, oral insulin was given as antigen-specific immunotherapy before the onset of autoimmunity in children from age 6\u00a0months to assess its safety and immune response actions on immunity and the gut microbiome.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA phase I/II randomised controlled trial was performed in a single clinical study centre in Germany. Participants were 44 islet autoantibody-negative children aged 6\u00a0months to 2.99\u00a0years who had a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes and a susceptible HLA DR4-DQ8-containing genotype. Children were randomised 1:1 to daily oral insulin (7.5\u00a0mg with dose escalation to 67.5\u00a0mg) or placebo for 12\u00a0months using a web-based computer system. The primary outcome was immune efficacy pre-specified as induction of antibody or T cell responses to insulin and measured in a central treatment-blinded laboratory.\nRESULTS\n\n\nRandomisation was performed in 44 children. One child in the placebo group was withdrawn after the first study visit and data from 22 insulin-treated and 21 placebo-treated children were analysed. Oral insulin was well tolerated with no changes in metabolic variables. Immune responses to insulin were observed in children who received both insulin (54.5%) and placebo (66.7%), and the trial did not demonstrate an effect on its primary outcome (p\u2009=\u20090.54). In exploratory analyses, there was preliminary evidence that the immune response and gut microbiome were modified by the INS genotype Among children with the type 1 diabetes-susceptible INS genotype (n\u2009=\u200922), antibody responses to insulin were more frequent in insulin-treated (72.7%) as compared with placebo-treated children (18.2%; p\u2009=\u20090.03). T cell responses to insulin were modified by treatment-independent inflammatory episodes.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION\n\n\nThe study demonstrated that oral insulin immunotherapy in young genetically at-risk children was safe, but was not associated with an immune response as predefined in the trial primary outcome. Exploratory analyses suggested that antibody responses to oral insulin may occur in children with a susceptible INS genotype, and that inflammatory episodes may promote the activation of insulin-responsive T cells.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT02547519 FUNDING: The main funding source was the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.).",

Urticaria is caused by cutaneous mast cell degranulation, attributed to immunological, nonimmunological, and idiopathic causes. Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is the diagnosis when the pathophysiological mechanism of persistent urticaria remains unclear; up to half of patients with CIU have functional autoantibodies directed against the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) or against IgE itself, which appear to induce mast cell degranulation. Systemic histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as desloratadine, are central to the management of CIU. The efficacy and safety of desloratadine, 5 mg once daily, was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial that included 190 patients, ages 12 and above, with at least a 6-week history of CIU and experiencing a flare of at least moderate severity. Desloratadine was superior to placebo in controlling pruritus and total symptoms after the first dose, and its superiority was maintained throughout the full 6 weeks of the study.

Some patients with CSU respond poorly to a fourfold increase in dosage of H1-anti-histamines treatment.  Aim.  The objective of this study was to determine the effect of an adjunct treatment of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on remission rate and reduction of urticarial symptoms.  Methods.  Sixty subjects with anti-histamine refractory CSU were randomly assigned to 400 mg of HCQ daily or placebo for 12 weeks in a single blind placebo controlled trial. In a second follow up trial, non-remission subjects were offered open-label HCQ in the placebo group or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in the HCQ group for 12 weeks. All subjects took 4 H1-anti-histamines tablets throughout the study. The endpoints measured were the urticarial symptom score (USS) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI).  Results.  Forty-eight patients (24 HCQ, 24 placebos) completed the randomized trial medication. Five of 24 on HCQ treatment but none on placebo had a remission at 12 weeks (P = 0.01). There was a low proportion of therapeutic failures occurred with 12-week HCQ treatment (n = 5) compared with placebo (n = 14, P = 0.001). After 12 weeks, USS and DLQI significantly improved in HCQ group over the placebo group. Forty non-remission subjects completed an open-label HCQ (n = 22) or LTRA (n = 18) comparison study. The remission rates on HCQ and LTRA were 22.72% and 5.55% at 12 weeks. However, no significant difference between the two groups in the therapeutic responses was observed. The mean USS on HCQ significantly decreased compared to the LTRA group, but there was no significant difference in DLQI. The adverse events reported were minimal and there were no subjects who discontinued the trial.  Conclusions.  This study suggests that HCQ is clinically effective as an adjunct treatment for CSU.",

After a standardized history and physical examination, patients were randomized into treatment with either loratadine (10 mg/day for 3 days) or prednisolene (50 mg/day for 3 days). All patients were followed up until complete remission. Most patients suffered from moderate (42%) to severe (40%) disease. Possible eliciting factors were identified in less than 50% of the cases. Associated upper respiratory tract infections were found most commonly (39.5%), followed by possibly eliciting drugs, mostly analgesics (9.2%) and suspected food intolerance (0.9%). The course of the disease was self-limited in all cases, the longest episode lasting for 3 weeks.

        "a1_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nMethotrexate is a folic acid antagonist widely used for the treatment of neoplastic disorders. Methotrexate inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins by binding to dihydrofolate reductase. Currently, methotrexate is among the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is an update of the previous Cochrane systematic review published in 1997.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo evaluate short term benefits and harms of methotrexate for treating RA compared to placebo.\nSEARCH METHODS\n\n\nThe Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1966 to 1997 and then updated to November 2013. The search was complemented with a bibliography search of the reference lists of trials retrieved from the electronic search.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\n\nRandomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy against placebo alone in people with RA. Any trial duration and MTX doses were included.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nTwo review authors independently determined which studies were eligible for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were pooled using mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables or standardized mean differences (SMDs) when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. Pooled risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous variables. Fixed-effect models were used throughout, although random-effects models were used for outcomes showing heterogeneity.\nMAIN RESULTS\n\n\nFive trials with 300 patients were included in the original version of the review. An additional two trials with 432 patients were added to the 2013 update of the review for a total of 732 participants. The trials were generally of unclear to low risk of bias with a follow-up duration ranging from 12 to 52 weeks. All trials included patients who have failed prior treatment (for example, gold therapy, D-penicillamine, azathioprine or anti-malarials); mean disease duration that ranged between 1 and 14 years with six trials reporting more than 4 years; and weekly doses that ranged between 5 mg and 25 mg.\nBENEFITS\n\n\nStatistically significant and clinically important differences were observed for most efficacy outcomes. MTX monotherapy showed a clinically important and statistically significant improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate when compared with placebo at 52 weeks (RR 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 6.0; number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI 4 to 22). Fifteen more patients out of 100 had a major improvement in the ACR 50 outcome compared to placebo (absolute treatment benefit (ATB) 15%, 95% CI 8% to 23%).Statistically significant improvement in physical function (scale of 0 to 3) was also observed in patients receiving MTX alone compared with placebo at 12 to 52 weeks (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.16; odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% CI 0.23 to 32.2; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 7). Nine more patients out of 100 improved in physical function compared to placebo (ATB -9%, 95% CI -13% to -5.3%). Similarly, the proportion of patients who improved at least 20% on the Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component was higher in the MTX-treated group compared with placebo at 52 weeks (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1; NNT 9, 95% CI 4 to 539). Twelve more patients out of 100 showed an improvement of at least 20% in the physical component of the quality of life measure compared to placebo (ATB 12%, 95% CI 1% to 24%). No clinically important or statistically significant differences were observed in the SF-36 mental component.Although no statistically significant differences were observed in radiographic scores (that is, Total Sharp score, erosion score, joint space narrowing), radiographic progression rates (measured by an increase in erosion scores of more than 3 units on a scale ranging from 0 to 448) were statistically significantly lower for patients in the MTX group compared with placebo-treated patients (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.86; NNT 13, 95% CI 10 to 60). Eight more patients out of 100 showed less damage to joints measured by an increase in erosion scores compared to placebo (ATB -8%, 95% CI -16% to -1%). In the one study measuring remission, no participants in either group met the remission criteria. These are defined by at least five of (\u2265 2 months): morning stiffness of < 15 minutes, no fatigue, no joint pain by history, no joint tenderness, no joint swelling, and Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of < 20 mm/hr in men and < 30 mm/hr in women.\nHARMS\n\n\nPatients in the MTX monotherapy group were twice as likely to discontinue from the study due to adverse events compared to patients in the placebo group, at 12 to 52 weeks (16% versus 8%; RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.3; NNT 13, 95% CI 6 to 44). Compared to placebo, nine more people out of 100 who took MTX withdrew from the studies because of side effects (ATB 9%, 95% CI 3% to 14%). Total adverse event rates at 12 weeks were higher in the MTX monotherapy group compared to the placebo group (45% versus 15%; RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.4; NNT 4, 95% CI 2 to 17). Thirty more people out of 100 who took MTX compared to those who took placebo experienced any type of side effect (common or rare) (ATB 30, 95% CI 13% to 47%). No statistically significant differences were observed in the total number of serious adverse events between the MTX group and the placebo group at 27 to 52 weeks. Three people out of 100 who took MTX alone experienced rare but serious side effects compared to 2 people out of 100 who took a placebo (3% versus 2%, respectively).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nBased on mainly moderate to high quality evidence, methotrexate (weekly doses ranging between 5 mg and 25 mg) showed a substantial clinical and statistically significant benefit compared to placebo in the short term treatment (12 to 52 weeks) of people with RA, although its use was associated with a 16% discontinuation rate due to adverse events.",

        "a2_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nA methotrexate autoinjector (MTXAI) was developed for self-administration of subcutaneous (SC) methotrexate by patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The MTXAI circumvents the need for vials, needles, and syringes and may therefore improve dosing accuracy, handling risks, and patient adherence.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate actual human use of the MTXAI in patients with RA and determine its reliability, robustness, safety, local tolerance, and ease of use.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-dose, single-arm, in-clinic US study, adults (N = 101) treated with methotrexate for 3 months or longer were trained to use the MTXAI and assigned to 10, 15, 20, or 25 mg methotrexate based on previous treatment and disease status. Patients completed training confirmation and ease-of-use questionnaires. Pain was evaluated immediately after self-administration and at follow-up with a 100-mm visual analog scale (0 = no pain, 100 = worst possible pain).\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt screening, 90.1% of patients had moderate to severe functional limitations (class II-IV). All patients successfully completed the study. All devices functioned correctly and as intended. The device was rated easy to use by 98%, and instructions clear and easy to follow by 100% of patients. On the visual analog scale, mean and median pain scores were 3.6/100 and 1.0/100 mm, respectively, immediately after self-administration, and were lower at follow-up. Most patients (92.3%) had no administration-site erythema; 7.7% had minimal erythema.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe SC MTXAI was well tolerated and considered easy to use by patients with RA. Improving SC methotrexate delivery may increase patient tolerance of self-administration, possibly improving adherence.",

Electroporation, making small pores in cell membranes, has proven useful for drug delivery. The safety of a combination therapy of methotrexate (MTX) and electroporation for local joint inflammation in RA was investigated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory study (UMIN000016606). The patients were randomly allocated to groups receiving a combination of MTX and electroporation (True-EP) and MTX alone (False-EP) groups. The MTX solution was injected into finger joints under ultrasound guidance. The True-EP group underwent electroporation with MTX, and the False-EP group was given MTX but only pinched using the electrode. The ultrasound grade, disease activity, and safety were evaluated from baseline to 26\u2009weeks. Five patients (3 True-EP and 2 False-EP) with a mean age of 57.4\u2009years and disease duration of 10.2\u2009years were enrolled. The grey-scale grade was unchanged in 3 cases (2 True-EP and 1 False-EP) and increased in 2 cases (1 True-EP and 1 False-EP). Disease activity was alleviated in 3 cases (2 True-EP and 1 False-EP). No patients experienced burned skin or electroshock. The combination therapy of electroporation and MTX was safe for RA patients.",

Patients were randomized to receive the test drug, a prefilled pen (Metex(\u00ae) PEN/Metoject(\u00ae) PEN), or the reference drug, a prefilled syringe (Metex(\u00ae)/Metoject(\u00ae)), at doses of 15, 17.5, or 20 mg MTX SC once a week for 3 weeks. This was followed by receipt of the reference drug (prefilled syringe) or the test drug (prefilled pen) in a crossover design, with each patient serving as his/her own control. Questionnaires regarding patient preference, the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ), and diaries regarding local tolerability were used to document outcomes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOverall patient preference for the MTX prefilled pen was 75% (P<0.0001). In a six-item questionnaire, 73% to 76% of the patients preferred the prefilled pen in relation to use, acceptability, and satisfaction, and 67% of the patients confirmed that it did not take much effort to overcome SC self-injection with the pen. The SIAQ showed no clinical differences, in any domain scores, between both devices. Overall patient attitude towards self-injection at baseline was positive, as was patient experience with both devices during the study. As well, 92% of physicians and study nurses indicated that they would recommend the MTX prefilled pen to patients for future MTX treatment. The formulations were generally well tolerated.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nSC self-injection of MTX with a prefilled pen was generally preferred, by patients with RA, over a prefilled syringe with regard to use, acceptability, and satisfaction. This is supported by the strong appreciation of their attending study nurses and physicians, for its convenience.",

        "a6_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune disease worldwide and requires long-term treatment to suppress inflammation. Currently, treatment is started when arthritis is clinically apparent. We aimed to evaluate whether earlier intervention, in the preceding phase of arthralgia and subclinical joint inflammation, could prevent the development of clinical arthritis or reduce the disease burden.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept-trial at the Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands. Adults aged 18 years or older with arthralgia clinically suspected of progressing to rheumatoid arthritis and MRI-detected subclinical joint inflammation were eligible for enrolment across 13 rheumatology outpatient clinics in the southwest region of the Netherlands and randomly assigned (1:1) to a single intramuscular glucocorticoid injection (120 mg) and a 1-year course of oral methotrexate (up to 25 mg/week), or placebo (single injection and tablets for 1 year). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. Follow-up continued for 1 year after the end of the 1-year treatment period. The primary endpoint was development of clinical arthritis (fulfilling the 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria or involving two or more joints) that persisted for at least 2 weeks. Patient-reported physical functioning, symptoms, and work productivity were secondary endpoints, which were measured every 4 months. Additionally, the course of MRI-detected inflammation was studied. All participants entered the intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2014-004472-35, and the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR4853-trial-NL4599.\nFINDINGS\n\n\nBetween April 16, 2015, and Sept 11, 2019, 901 patients were assessed for eligibility and 236 were enrolled and randomly assigned to active treatment (n=119) or placebo (n=117). At 2 years, the frequency of the primary endpoint was similar between the groups (23 [19%] of 119 participants in the treatment group vs 21 [18%] of 117 in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0\u00b781, 95% CI 0\u00b745 to 1\u00b748). Physical functioning improved more in the treatment group during the first 4 months and remained better than in the placebo group (mean between-group difference in Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index over 2 years: -0\u00b709, 95% CI -0\u00b716 to -0\u00b703; p=0\u00b70042). Similarly, pain (on scale 0-100, mean between-group difference: -8, 95% CI -12 to -4; p<0\u00b70001), morning stiffness of joints (-12, -16 to -8; p<0\u00b70001), presenteeism (-8%, -13 to -3; p=0\u00b70007), and MRI-detected joint inflammation (-1\u00b74 points, -2\u00b70 to -0\u00b79; p<0\u00b70001) showed sustained improvement in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. The number of serious adverse events was equal in both groups; adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile for methotrexate.\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nMethotrexate, the cornerstone treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, initiated at the pre-arthritis stage of symptoms and subclinical inflammation, did not prevent the development of clinical arthritis, but modified the disease course as shown by sustained improvement in MRI-detected inflammation, related symptoms, and impairments compared with placebo.\nFUNDING\n\n\nDutch Research Council (NWO; Dutch Arthritis Society).",

At weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and every 4 weeks thereafter, betamethasone was injected into swollen joints (maximum 4 joints or 4 ml per visit). Beginning at week 8, if synovitis was present, the methotrexate dosage was increased stepwise up to 20 mg/week, with a subsequent stepwise increase in the cyclosporine or placebo-cyclosporine dosage up to 4 mg/kg.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt 52 weeks, 20% improvement according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) was achieved in 85% of the combination therapy group versus 68% of the monotherapy group (P = 0.02). The median individual overall ACR response (ACR-N) in the 2 groups was 80.0% (interquartile range 40.1-91.8%) and 54.5% (interquartile range 2.4-87.8%), respectively (P = 0.025). At 48 and 52 weeks, ACR remission criteria were met in 35% of the combination therapy group and 28% of the monotherapy group. Progression in the Larsen score at 52 weeks was -0.2 +/- 6.5 and 0.4 +/- 6.9 (mean +/- SD) in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively. Serum creatinine levels increased by 7%, and hypertrichosis was more prevalent, in the combination therapy group.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nCombined treatment with methotrexate and intraarticular glucocorticoid showed excellent disease control and stopped the progression of erosions in patients with early active RA, who had a poor prognosis. Addition of cyclosporine improved the ACR20 and ACR-N responses, whereas the ACR50 and ACR70 responses, remission rates, and radiographic changes did not differ between the 2 study groups.",

The methotrexate group had significant reductions (P less than 0.01 as compared with the placebo group) in the number of tender or painful joints, the duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity according to physician and patient assessments at the 12-week crossover visit; reductions in the number of swollen joints (P less than 0.05) and 15-m walking time (P less than 0.03) also occurred. These variables, as well as the grip strength and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, showed significant (P less than 0.01) improvement at 24 weeks in the population crossed over to methotrexate. A significantly increased frequency (P less than 0.03) of the HLA-DR2 haplotype occurred in the eight patients with the most substantial response to methotrexate. Adverse reactions during methotrexate therapy included transaminase elevation (21 per cent), nausea (18 per cent), and diarrhea (12 per cent); one patient was withdrawn from the trial because of diarrhea. One patient died while receiving the placebo. Methotrexate did not affect measures of humoral or cellular immunity. We conclude that this trial provides evidence of the short-term efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Longer trials will be required to determine the ultimate safety and effectiveness of this drug.",

Adult patients with RA (ACR/EULAR 2010) receiving MTX (orally or by injection) for at least 3\u00a0months were allocated to AI or PFS for 6\u00a0months and then were allocated to AI for 6 further months. Two co-primary endpoints were defined at M6: percentage of patients with compliance at least 80%; change in functional capacity assessed by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Secondary endpoints included quality of life (RaQoL), RA activity (DAS28), and acceptability. Local safety at injection site was assessed at each visit.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTwo-hundred and sixty-five patients were randomized. The main analysis was conducted on per protocol set (99 AI and 98 PFS). Compliance was 96.2% in AI and 98.9% in PFS. Good complier rates were 89.9% and 94.9%, thus a difference of -\u20095.0% (-\u200918.9%; 8.9%). HAQ remained stable in both groups.

This condition can exact a significant toll on the general health and quality of life in the affected individual. Despite the frequency and consequences of dysthymia, however, the condition is often not diagnosed or treated. We present data on prior treatment from 410 patients with DSM-III-R dysthymia, primary type, early onset without concurrent major depression.\nMETHOD\n\n\nAxis I and II diagnoses were made by using the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-III-R, Patient Version (SCID-P) and SCID II for Personality Disorders. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Clinical Global Impressions scale were also completed. Prior treatment was assessed, with special attention paid to previous antidepressant drug therapy and psychotherapy.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAlthough the mean duration of dysthymia was about 30 years and almost half of the patients had previous episodes of major depression, only 41.3% had been treated with antidepressants and 56.1% with psychotherapy. A past history of major depression increased the frequency of prior antidepressant pharmacotherapy (45.7%) and psychotherapy (59.4%) compared with no history of major depression (36.8% and 40.9%, respectively). Comorbid personality disorder increased the likelihood of prior psychotherapy (70.7% vs. 49.6%) while having no effect on past pharmacotherapy. A history of substance abuse did not affect the history of antidepressant or psychotherapy treatment. In this study, dysthymia and psychosocial outcomes improved with sertraline and imipramine treatment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nDysthymic patients in this sample were significantly undertreated.

In doing so, 50 patients above the age of 18 were selected through convenience sampling and assigned into intervention and control groups. The control group only received medications while the intervention group in addition to receiving medication, participated in 8 sessions of a mindfulness based cognitive therapy course which was held once a week and each session lasted for 2 to 2.5 hours. All the participants filled out Beck Depression Inventory II and five facet mindfulness questionnaire. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software (version 16) and univariate covariance and independent t test statistical methods.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn this study, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding the demographic characteristics. The mean difference between the two groups was statistically significant for the variables in post-test considering the pre-test. The experimental group participants showed significant improvement in terms of the defined variables; a trend which was not observed in the control group participants.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe results of this study show that adding MBCT to pharmacotherapy in treatment of dysthymic patients can cause significant improvement in depression symptoms and mindfulness skills in patients compared to pharmacotherapy alone.",

In this investigation, we measured the long-term outcome in a large group of patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for dysthymia. This study was designed to investigate whether fluoxetine is effective in the treatment of dysthymia.\nMETHOD\n\n\nThis randomised study including 140 patients, compared fluoxetine (91 patients) and placebo (49 patients) on a double-blind basis in two distinct phases: a short-term end-point (3 months with 20 mg/day fluoxetine) and a medium-term end-point (6 months) where the initial responders continued double-blind treatment unchanged and non-responders received an additional treatment of 20 mg/day fluoxetine.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAfter three months of treatment, response was seen more frequently in the fluoxetine group (42/72) than in the placebo group (14/39, P < 0.0001).

The finding that 50% of the non-responders at 3 months were improved at 6 months, after fluoxetine dosage was increased to 40 mg daily, argues in favour of treating dysthymic patients for at least 6 months, and with a higher dosage if the initial doses are ineffective.",

With the use of a Clinical Global impressions improvement score of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved) to define response, response rates were 59% for sertraline, 64% for imipramine, and 44% for placebo (P = .02 for sertraline vs placebo and P < .001 for imipramine vs placebo). A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving imipramine than those receiving sertraline or placebo discontinued treatment because of adverse events (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nPharmacotherapy provides considerable relief from the symptoms of dysthymia in patients suffering from this chronic affective disorder, with both sertraline and imipramine being more effective than placebo.

Bhramari pranayama, which is a breathing exercise in the practice of yoga, offers an inexpensive and free from side effect modality in this regard.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Bhramari pranayama in relieving the symptoms of chronic sinusitis.\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n\nA total of 60 patients with chronic sinusitis were randomly divided into two groups, one received conventional treatment of chronic sinusitis and the other group was in addition taught to practice yogic breathing exercise Bhramari pranayama. The patients were advised to practice this breathing exercise twice a day and were followed up at 1, 4, and 12 weeks using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22 score).\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe mean SNOT-22 score in the group following the Bhramari pranayama breathing exercise using the ANOVA test improved from 39.13 \u00b1 9.10 to 24.79 \u00b1 8.31 ( P  = 0.0002), this improvement was seen by the end of 4 weeks itself and continued until the 12 th  week of assessment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIntegrating regular practice of Bhramari pranayama along with the conventional management of chronic rhinosinusitis is more effective than conventional management alone.",

Deep diaphragmatic training resulted in significant reductions in medication use and in the intensity of asthmatic symptoms. Importantly, a nearly 300% increase in time spent in physical activities also resulted from deep diaphragmatic training.

        "a4_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nPrevious studies have shown that breathing techniques reduce short acting beta(2) agonist use and improve quality of life (QoL) in asthma. The primary aim of this double blind study was to compare the effects of breathing exercises focusing on shallow nasal breathing with those of non-specific upper body exercises on asthma symptoms, QoL, other measures of disease control, and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose. This study also assessed the effect of peak flow monitoring on outcomes in patients using breathing techniques.\nMETHODS\n\n\nAfter a 2 week run in period, 57 subjects were randomised to one of two breathing techniques learned from instructional videos. During the following 30 weeks subjects practised their exercises twice daily and as needed for relief of symptoms. After week 16, two successive ICS downtitration steps were attempted. The primary outcome variables were QoL score and daily symptom score at week 12.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOverall there were no clinically important differences between the groups in primary or secondary outcomes at weeks 12 or 28. The QoL score remained unchanged (0.7 at baseline v 0.5 at week 28, p = 0.11 both groups combined), as did lung function and airway responsiveness. However, across both groups, reliever use decreased by 86% (p<0.0001) and ICS dose was reduced by 50% (p<0.0001; p>0.10 between groups). Peak flow monitoring did not have a detrimental effect on asthma outcomes.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nBreathing techniques may be useful in the management of patients with mild asthma symptoms who use a reliever frequently, but there is no evidence to favour shallow nasal breathing over non-specific upper body exercises.",

Intraocular pressure maintenance is influenced by autonomic activity (sympathetic and parasympathetic). \"Yogic pranayama\" and \"diaphragmatic breathing\" are exercises that can affect autonomic activity by stimulating a wakeful hypometabolic state of parasympathetic dominance. We aimed to assess the effect of yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing on intraocular pressure to determine whether it can be recommended for individuals with established glaucoma in combination with glaucoma medication as an adjuvant therapy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nIn this prospective, randomized trial, 90 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (180 eyes, age: above 40\u2009y) were assigned to either the control or yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing exercise group. In the latter group, yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing were practiced daily for 6 months. We measured the intraocular pressure at presentation and subsequently after 1, 3, and 6 months.\nRESULTS\n\n\nCompared with the wait-list group, the yogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing exercise group had significantly lowered intraocular pressure (right eye: 20.85\u00b13.39 to 14.90\u00b12.86\u2009mm\u2009Hg; left eye: 20.30\u00b14.12 to 14.25\u00b13.85\u2009mm\u2009Hg; P<0.001).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nYogic pranayama and diaphragmatic breathing exercises can reduce intraocular pressure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and can therefore be recommended as an adjuvant therapy.",

Participants were given a series of breathing exercises to perform weekly in the clinic and at home. Balance and breathing were assessed at the weekly clinic sessions. Breathing was evaluated with Liebenson's breathing assessment, static balance with the Modified Balance Error Scoring System, and dynamic balance with OptoGait's March in Place protocol.\nRESULTS\n\n\nImprovement was noted in mean diaphragmatic breathing scores (1.3 to 2.6, P < .001), number of single-leg stance balance errors (7.1 to 3.8, P = .001), and tandem stance balance errors (3.2 to 0.9, P = .039). A decreasing error rate in single-leg stance was associated with improvement in breathing score within participants over the 8 weeks of the study (-1.4 errors/unit breathing score change, P < .001). Tandem stance performance did not reach statistical significance (-0.5 error/unit change, P = .118). Dynamic balance was insensitive to balance change, being error free for all participants throughout the study.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis proof-of-concept study indicated that promotion of a costal-diaphragmatic breathing pattern may be associated with improvement in balance and suggests that a study of this phenomenon using an experimental design is feasible.",

        "a7_doc": "Chronic rhinitis patients often suffer from unrefreshing sleep and snoring, related to increased nasal resistance to airflow. Previous trials based on subjective assessment of snoring have demonstrated beneficial effects of Breathe Right (BR), a noninvasive external nasal dilator. Polysomnography (PSG) was applied to objectively assess the effects of BR on snoring. Twelve nonobese chronic rhinitis patients participated in the present study, which had a randomized, placebo-controlled design. The presence of snoring and the absence of sleep apnoea was demonstrated during a baseline overnight sleep study. Patients were then randomized for placebo or true nasal dilator treatment, which was also assessed by overnight PSG. The use of BR had no effect on sleep quality, arousal-index apnoea-hypopnoea-index or snoring loudness. Snoring frequency was significantly lowered by BR (173+/-29 snores x h(-l)), compared with placebo (258+/-34 snores x h(-1); p=0.016). The results support the hypothesis that Breathe Right is effective in reducing the amount of snoring in patients with chronic rhinitis.

When these structures become incompetent, gastric contents may cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). For treatment, lifestyle interventions are always recommended. We hypothesized that by actively training the crura of the diaphragm as part of the LES using breathing training exercises, GERD can be positively influenced.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA prospective randomized controlled study was performed. Patients with non-erosive GERD or healed esophagitis without large hernia and/or previous surgery were included. Patients were randomized and allocated either to active breathing training program or to a control group. Quality of life (QoL), pH-metry, and on-demand proton pump inhibitor (PPI) usage were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of training. For long-term follow-up, all patients were invited to continue active breathing training and were further assessed regarding QoL and PPI usage after 9 months. Paired and unpaired t-test was used for statistical analysis.\nRESULTS\n\n\nNineteen patients with non-erosive GERD or healed esophagitis were randomized into two groups (10 training group and 9 control group). There was no difference in baseline patient characteristics between the groups and all patients finished the study. There was a significant decrease in time with a pH<4.0 in the training group (9.1\u00b11.3 vs. 4.7\u00b10.9%; P<0.05), but there was no change in the control group. QoL scores improved significantly in the training group (13.4\u00b11.98 before and 10.8\u00b11.86 after training; P<0.01), but no changes in QoL were seen in the control group.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of participants in the intervention arms of the BREATHE trial, which investigated the effectiveness of breathing retraining as a mode of asthma management. Sixteen people with asthma (11 women, 8 per group) who had taken part in the intervention arms of the BREATHE trial (breathing retraining delivered by digital versatile disc (DVD) or face-to-face sessions with a respiratory physiotherapist) took part in semi-structured telephone interviews about their experiences. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Breathing retraining was perceived positively as a method of asthma management. Motivations for taking part included being asked, to enhance progress in research, to feel better/reduce symptoms, and to reduce medication. Participants were positive about the physiotherapist, liked having the materials tailored, found meetings motivational, and liked the DVD and booklet. The impact of breathing retraining following regular practice included increased awareness of breathing and development of new habits. Benefits of breathing retraining included increased control over breathing, reduced need for medication, feeling more relaxed, and improved health and quality of life. Problems included finding time to practice the exercises, and difficulty mastering techniques. Breathing retraining was acceptable and valued by almost all participants, and many reported improved wellbeing. Face to face physiotherapy was well received. However, some participants in the DVD group mentioned being unable to master techniques.\nASTHMA\n\n\nPATIENTS RECEPTIVE TO BREATHING RETRAINING: Patients with asthma taught how to change their unconscious breathing patterns generally like non-pharmacological interventions. Researchers in the UK, led by Mike Thomas from the University of Southampton, interviewed 16 people about their experiences in a trial that tested breathing retraining exercises delivered by DVD or face-to-face sessions with a respiratory physiotherapist. Overwhelmingly, trial participants reported that breathing retraining sessions gave them greater control over their symptoms, helped them relax, improved their quality of life and reduced the need for medications. Some participants who received DVD instruction said they had trouble mastering the techniques, and many in both groups found it hard to find time to practice the exercises. Overall, however, patients were positive about the experience. The authors conclude that breathing exercises are likely to be a well-received method of asthma management.",

I got my first attack in February and was following the advice of avoiding high purine foods. I found something on YouTube which talked about inflammation being the main culprit behind gout flare ups. The guy on that video was suggesting a keto diet which I haven't done. I've mostly tried to cut out a lot of extra carbs and really limit my alcohol intake. I've been taking turmeric and lots of ginger, as well. It seems to have worked, until a couple days ago I started to feel a flare up after a couple days of drinking more beer. I also got some gout tea from my mom who found it in Chinatown. It seems to work well but isn't cheap. It's sold online as Pure Chinese Herbal Formula, Special Gout Tea. Has anyone else has luck with either of these?",

        "a4_doc": "The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet reduces serum urate (SU); however, the impact of the DASH diet has not been previously evaluated among patients with gout. We conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover pilot study to test the effects of ~$105/week ($15/day) of dietitian-directed groceries (DDG), patterned after the DASH diet, on SU, compared with self-directed grocery shopping (SDG). Participants had gout and were not taking urate lowering therapy. Each intervention period lasted 4 weeks; crossover occurred without a washout period. The primary endpoint was SU. Compliance was assessed by end-of-period fasting spot urine potassium and sodium measurements and self-reported consumption of daily servings of fruit and vegetables. We randomized 43 participants (19% women, 49% black, mean age 59 years) with 100% follow-up. Mean baseline SU was 8.1 mg/dL (SD, 0.8). During Period 1, DDG lowered SU by 0.55 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.07, 1.04) compared to SDG by 0.0 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.44, 0.44). However, after crossover (Period 2), the SU difference between groups was the opposite: SDG reduced SU by -0.48 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.98, 0.01) compared to DDG by -0.05 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.48, 0.38; P for interaction by period = 0.11). Nevertheless, DDG improved self-reported intake of fruit and vegetables (3.1 servings/day; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.8) and significantly reduced total spot urine sodium excretion by 22 percentage points (95% CI: -34.0, -8.6). Though relatively small in scale, this pilot study suggests that dietitian-directed, DASH-patterned groceries may lower SU among gout patients not on urate-lowering drugs. However, behavior intervention crossover trials without a washout period are likely vulnerable to strong carryover effects. Definitive evaluation of the DASH diet as a treatment for gout will require a controlled feeding trial, ideally with a parallel-design.",

The aim of this study was to describe patterns of gout flare and assess the concurrent validity of different methods of flare reporting in a gout clinical trial.\nMETHODS\n\n\nDaily flare diary entries including self-report of flare and pain scale from a randomised controlled trial of 120 patients with gout were analysed. Detailed pain-by-time plots for each participant were inspected and analysed for different methods of flare reporting for both self-report and the classification tree (CART)-defined flare developed by Gaffo in 2012. Concurrent validity for different methods of flare reporting were analysed.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAlthough the single gout flare had a 'typical' average pattern (peak on day 1 and resolution over 14\u2009days), individual pain-by-time plots showed wide variation in pain intensity, duration and frequency of flares. Over the four-month study period, there were 84/120 (70%) participants who experienced at least one self-reported flare that was not a 'typical' flare. The time to first self-reported flare correlated poorly with other measures of gout activity and other methods of flare reporting. The number of days with flare (either self-reported or Gaffo-defined) and the area under the pain-by-time curve correlated most strongly with other measures of disease severity.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThere is wide variation in the patterns of flare over time in individuals with gout, leading to challenges for flare reporting in clinical trials. Time-dependent reporting strategies such as number of days with flare or area under the pain-by-time curve correlate well with other measures of gout disease severity and may provide a more accurate measure of flare burden.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinical trial number: ACTRN12609000479202, registered 17/06/2009.",

Cherries, which are rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidative bioactive compounds, are proposed to be efficacious in preventing and treating gout, but recommendations to patients are conflicting. Cherry consumption has been demonstrated to lower serum urate levels and inflammation in several small studies. One observational case cross-over study reported that cherry consumption was associated with reduced risk of recurrent gout attacks. This preliminary evidence requires substantiation. The proposed randomised clinical trial aims to test the effect of consumption of tart cherry juice on risk of gout attacks.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nThis 12-month, parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will recruit 120 individuals (aged 18-80 years) with a clinical diagnosis of gout who have self-reported a gout flare in the previous year. Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention group, which will receive Montmorency tart cherry juice daily for a 12-month period, or a corresponding placebo group, which will receive a cherry-flavoured placebo drink. The primary study outcome is change in frequency of self-reported gout attacks. Secondary outcome measures include attack intensity, serum urate concentration, fractional excretion of uric acid, biomarkers of inflammation, blood lipids and other markers of cardiovascular risk.

        "a8_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nGout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo assess the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs)) for acute gout.\nSEARCH METHODS\n\n\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for studies to 28 August 2020. We applied no date or language restrictions.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\n\nWe considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain, inflammation, function, participant-reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nWe used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.\nMAIN RESULTS\n\n\nWe included in this update 28 trials (3406 participants), including 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo, 6 (1244 participants) compared non-selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), 5 (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids, 13 compared one NSAID to another NSAID (633 participants), and single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases. We report numerical data for the primary comparison NSAIDs versus placebo and brief results for the two comparisons - NSAIDs versus COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs versus glucocorticoids. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) from 1 trial (30 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to placebo. More participants (11/15) may have a 50% reduction in pain at 24 hours with NSAIDs than with placebo (4/15) (risk ratio (RR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 6.7), with absolute improvement of 47% (3.5% more to 152.5% more). NSAIDs may have little to no effect on inflammation (swelling) after four days (13/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 12/15 participants taking placebo; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), with absolute improvement of 6.4% (16.8% fewer to 39.2% more). There may be little to no difference in function (4-point scale; 1 = complete resolution) at 24 hours (4/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 1/15 participants taking placebo; RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 31.7), with absolute improvement of 20% (3.3% fewer to 204.9% more). NSAIDs may result in little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (0 events in both groups) or in total adverse events; two adverse events (nausea and polyuria) were reported in the placebo group (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 3.8), with absolute difference of 10.7% more (13.2% fewer to 38% more). Treatment success and health-related quality of life were not measured. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 6 trials (1244 participants) shows non-selective NSAIDs compared to selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs). Non-selective NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (mean difference (MD) 0.03, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.14 higher), swelling (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.22 higher), treatment success (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 lower to 0.2 higher), or quality of life (MD -0.2, 95% CI -6.7 to 6.3) compared to COXIBs. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) suggests no difference in function (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.25) between groups. Non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.1) and total adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8). Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) based on 5 trials (712 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids. NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.7 to 3.0), inflammation (MD 0.3, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.6), function (MD -0.2, 95% CI -2.2 to 1.8), or treatment success (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events with NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids (RR 2.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 14.2). There was a decrease in total adverse events with glucocorticoids compared to NSAIDs (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nLow-certainty evidence from 1 placebo-controlled trial suggests that NSAIDs may improve pain at 24 hours and may have little to no effect on function, inflammation, or adverse events for treatment of acute gout. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that COXIBs and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial with regards to improvement in pain, function, inflammation, and treatment success, although non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs probably are equally beneficial in terms of pain relief, improvement in function, and treatment success. Withdrawals due to adverse events were also similar between groups, but NSAIDs probably result in more total adverse events. Low-certainty evidence suggests no difference in inflammation between groups. Only low-certainty evidence was available for the comparisons NSAID versus rilonacept and NSAID versus acupuncture from single trials, or one NSAID versus another NSAID, which also included many NSAIDs that are no longer in clinical use. Although these data were insufficient to support firm conclusions, they do not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, findings for other inflammatory arthritis, and expert consensus, all of which support the use of NSAIDs for acute gout.",

They were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The control group was treated according to Western Medicine guidelines. The intervention group was treated with integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine. The efficacy of TCM syndrome, joint pain score, joint swelling score, ESR, C-reactive protein, serum uric acid, liver and kidney function, and the duration of remission of TCM syndrome were compared between the two groups before and after treatments.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFor the patients with stable TCM syndrome, there was no significant difference in the effective rate and inefficiency between the intervention group and the control group. For the active type, the effective rate of the intervention group is better than the control group significantly. For the stable type, there was no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group in improving the scores of joint pain and swelling, reducing the level of ESR, C-reactive protein, serum uric acid and improving liver and kidney function. For the active type, the differences between the two groups were significant. The stable stage of gout in the intervention group was longer than the control group.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nFor the gout patients with stable TCM syndrome in the acute stage of gout, we can use TCM treatment or Western Medicine alternatively; for the patients with active TCM syndrome, the scheme of combination of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine can be applied, with the better curative effect than any medicine alone.",

        "a1_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nDespite the commonly known benefits of exercise and physical activity evidence shows that persons Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are relatively inactive yet physical activity may be even more important in a population facing functional deterioration. No exercise is effective if it is not done and people with MS face unique barriers to exercise engagement which need to be overcome. We have developed and pilot tested a Multiple Sclerosis Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP) and it is ready to be tested against general guidelines for superiority and ultimately for its impact on MS relevant outcomes. The primary research question is to what extent does an MS Tailored Exercise Program (MSTEP) result in greater improvements in exercise capacity and related outcomes over a one year period in comparison to a program based on general guidelines for exercise among people with MS who are sedentary and wish to engage in exercise as part of MS self-management.\nMETHODS/DESIGN\n\n\nThe proposed study is an assessor-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The duration of the intervention will be one year with follow-up to year two. The targeted outcomes are exercise capacity, functional ambulation, strength, and components of quality of life including frequency and intensity of fatigue symptoms, mood, global physical function, health perception, and objective measures of activity level. Logistic regression will be used to test the main hypothesis related to the superiority of the MSTEP program based on a greater proportion of people making a clinically relevant gain in exercise capacity at 1 year and at 2 years, using an intention-to-treat approach. Sample size will be 240 (120 per group).\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThe MS community is clearly looking for interventions to help alleviate the disabling sequelae of MS and promote health. Exercise is a well-known intervention which has known benefits to all, yet few exercise regularly. For people with MS, the role of exercise in MS management needs to be rigorously assessed to inform people as to how best to use exercise to reduce disability and promote health.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinical Trials.gov: NCT01611987.",

Every patient was evaluated according to physical fitness with peak oxygen consumption (V'O2peak), workload and anaerobic threshold; quality of life (SF-36); and degree of disability (EDSS). The patients were then randomised to an exercise group (EG) (n =6) or a control group (CG) (n = 10).

        "a9_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nMobility disability is a common, debilitating feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise training has been identified as an approach to improve MS-related mobility disability. However, exercise randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on mobility in MS have generally not selectively targeted those with the onset of irreversible mobility disability.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nThe current multi-site RCT compared the efficacy of 6-months of supervised, multimodal exercise training with an active control condition for improving mobility, gait, physical fitness, and cognitive outcomes in persons with substantial MS-related mobility disability.\nMETHODS\n\n\n83 participants with substantial MS-related mobility disability underwent initial mobility, gait, fitness, and cognitive processing speed assessments and were randomly assigned to 6-months of supervised multimodal (progressive aerobic, resistance, and balance) exercise training (intervention condition) or stretching-and-toning activities (control condition). Participants completed the same outcome assessments halfway through and immediately following the 6-month study period.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were statistically significant improvements in six-minute walk performance (F(2158)=3.12, p=0.05, \u03b7 p 2 =0.04), peak power output (F(2150)=8.16, p<0.01, \u03b7 p 2 =0.10), and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test performance (F(2162)=4.67, p=0.01, \u03b7 p 2 =0.05), but not gait outcomes, for those who underwent the intervention compared with those who underwent the control condition.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThis RCT provides novel, preliminary evidence that multimodal exercise training may improve endurance walking performance and cognitive processing speed, perhaps based on improvements in cardiorespiratory capacity, in persons with MS with substantial mobility disability. This is critical for informing the development of multi-site exercise rehabilitation programs in larger samples of persons with MS-related mobility disability.",

        "a10_doc": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease which affects young adults at a time of maximum personal, professional and social growth. Recent guidelines on physical activity have established that exercise is an essential component of the clinical management of people with MS with mild or moderate degree of disability. The main purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and the effects of two different 40-week structured physical exercise interventions (a supervised high intensity interval training plus home exercise program and a self-applied home-based exercise program) on clinical evolution, psychological wellbeing, quality of life, fatigue, cardiorespiratory fitness, strength and balance of people with MS. Twenty-nine participants with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) participated in this study. All of them were fully ambulatory and with minimal disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale <3), for at least the last six months. Participants selected to be part of a combined face-to-face plus home exercise group (CFTFG; n = 8); a self-applied home-based exercise group (HG; n = 11) or a control group (CG; n = 10). A total of 23 participants completed the protocol (79.3%), of which 8 participants (100%) from the CFTFG, 7 (63.6%) from the HG and 8 (80%) from the CG. During the first 20-weeks of training, adherence from the CFTFG reached 77.5% and from the HG reached 50 %. During the second 20-weeks of training, adherence from the CFTFG reached 62.5% and from the HG reached 45.4%. After 20-weeks of training, a significant improvement in the absolute VO 2  peak and in the 30-second sit to stand test was observed in the CFTFG (all  p  < .05). This study confirms that offering a 40-week structured exercise programme to a group of fully ambulatory and minimally disabled persons with RRMS is feasible and safe. Any adverse event related to the trial was reported by the participants.",

A catheter-free system provided esophageal pH monitoring over 4 days in 4 dietary conditions. A high-fat (50%) vs low-fat (25%) diet (calorie-controlled), and a high-calorie (1000 kcal) vs low-calorie (500 kcal) diet (fat-controlled) were provided in randomized order, and meal volume was controlled. The effects of meal consistency also were studied.\nRESULTS\n\n\nComplete data were available for 15 patients (6 men, 9 women; age, 48 y; range, 26-70 y; body mass index, 26 kg/m2; body mass index range, 21-35 kg/m2). Demographic variables and meal sequence had no effect on reflux parameters. Dietary composition had effects on esophageal acid exposure (F statistic [analysis of variance] = 7.4, P < .005) and symptoms (Friedman test = 24.2, P < .001). No effect of meal consistency was present. Esophageal acid exposure was greater during the high-calorie than the low-calorie diet (mean, 8.6% +/- 2.0% vs 5.2% +/- 1.4% time pH < 4/24 h; P < .01). No difference was observed between the high-fat and low-fat diets (mean, 8.6% +/- 2.0% vs 8.2% +/- 1.6% time pH < 4/24 h; P = NS). In contrast, the frequency of reflux symptoms was not affected by calorie density (median, 6; range, 2-12 vs median, 8; range, 2-13; P = NS) but was increased by the high-fat compared with the low-fat diet (median, 11; range, 5-18 vs median, 6; range, 2-12; P < .05).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCalorie density determines the severity of esophageal acid exposure in gastroesophageal reflux disease after a meal; however, the percentage fat content of the diet has important effects on the frequency of reflux symptoms.",

A pH electrode was positioned 5 cm above the cardia and the gamma detector was positioned externally over the pH electrode. The patients then received a technetium-99m labelled meal designed to provoke reflux. Thirty minutes later the patients were given a 20 ml dose of alginate (Liquid Gaviscon), or 20 ml of tap water. Incidence of reflux was monitored for approximately 4 h from the end of the meal.

The primary outcomes were esophageal acid exposure time (AET) and total number of reflux episodes derived from 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. Secondary outcomes were esophageal reflux symptoms rated using the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GERDQ) and GERD Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS).\nRESULTS\n\n\nHalf of the subjects were White and half African American (mean age, 60.0 \u00b1 12.5 years; mean body mass index, 32.7 \u00b1 5.4 kg/m 2 ). There was a significant main effect of diet treatment on AET ( P = 0.001) and on the total number of reflux episodes ( P = 0.003). The change in AET in the high total/low simple group (-4.3% \u00b1 3.8%) differed significantly from the high total/high simple control group (+3.1% \u00b1 3.7%), (P = 0.04). The reduction in simple sugar intake averaged 62 g less per day. Subjects' ratings of symptoms improved in all carbohydrate modification groups, including significant reductions in heartburn frequency, heartburn severity, acid taste in the mouth, lump/pain in the throat or chest, and sleep disturbance.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nA modification of dietary carbohydrate intake that targeted a substantial reduction in the intakes of simple sugars improved pH monitoring outcomes and symptoms of GERD that profoundly affect daily life. These findings provide a feasible and clinically applicable contribution to the limited objective data existing for efficacious dietary recommendations in the routine treatment and management of GERD.",

        "a5_doc": "The first step in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is lifestyle modification, with dietary recommendations such as increasing fiber intake and lowering dietary fat. While there is some physiological evidence that various foods as well as alcohol and tobacco affect the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), targeted interventions have not shown any benefit in clinical trials. The general recommendation is for the patient to avoid foods and beverages that in his or her experience trigger GERD symptoms. The only measures that have been shown with some degree of scientific evidence to be beneficial are weight loss on the part of obese patients and elevation of the head of the bed. We, in contrast, developed a training program that induces a change from thoracic to abdominal breathing. We hypothesized that this change in breathing actively trains the diaphragm, and so potentially strengthens the LES. In a randomized trial using breathing exercises as the intervention, we found an improvement in gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, assessed by quality of life, pH-metry and proton pump inhibitor use. Most patients would prefer to take proton pump inhibitors than to do exercises, but at least for a subgroup of highly motivated patients who would prefer an alternative to medication, structured physical exercises could offer new help with their GERD.",

Fasting blood samples from each patients were obtained; leukocytotoxic test was performed by incubating the blood with a panel of 60 food items to be tested. The reaction of leukocytes (rounding, vacuolization, lack of movement, flattening, fragmentation or disintegration of cell wall) was then evaluated by optical microscopy and rated as follows: level 0 = negative, level 1 = slightly positive, level 2 = moderately positive, and level 3 = highly positive.

The aim of this study was to assess in humans the physiological effects of the supplementation of the enteral diet with different types of dietary fibre on gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes, gastric acidity and gastric emptying.\nMETHODS\n\n\npH profiles were compared in 12 healthy volunteers between three different formula (500 kcal, 250 mL x h-1) delivered in a random order and containing either no fibre, either soy polysaccharide fibre only or mixed fibre from pea and inuline. Enteral diets were instilled through a nasogastric tube. Oesophageal and gastric pH recordings were combined with the ultrasound measurement of gastric antral area during the infusion.\nRESULTS\n\n\nMore GOR were observed with a fibre-free diet (median 4, range 1-10) than with a mixed (median 1.5, range 0-5) (P=0.04) or soy polysaccharide fibre (median 1.5, range 0-5) (P=0.04) diet.

In addition, the symptom association probability (SAP) was calculated for each measurement.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe total number of reflux episodes and proximal extent were not affected by PPI therapy. On PPI, there were fewer acid reflux episodes (49 +/- 34 off PPI vs 20 +/- 25 on PPI) while more weakly acidic reflux episodes were identified (24 +/- 17 off PPI vs 48 +/- 31 on PPI).

While gluten-free diet is applied by patients, there are no reported interventional studies. The low-FODMAP diet, on the other hand, has efficacy similar to that seen in patients with IBS in three unblinded or observational studies of IBD cohorts who had well-controlled inflammatory disease and in one small randomized cross-over study. FODMAP intake by patients with IBD is not elevated, and, in one study, fructan intakes were lower in patients with Crohn's disease than in controls. There is no clear relationship between the level of FODMAP intake and intestinal inflammation. The risk of compromising nutritional status with a restrictive diet must be seriously considered especially as under-nutrition is already common in this patient population. The effects of FODMAPs on the gut microbiota of patients with Crohn's disease mimic that in IBS, with a balance between prebiosis from the addition of FODMAPs and loss of prebiosis from their reduction. As undernutrition is common in IBD, the use of restrictive diets should be supervised by a dietitian. Thus, low-FODMAP diet is a viable option for IBS-like symptoms but should be carefully supervised to mitigate risk.",

After a 3-day qualifying period, mothers were provided a low FODMAP 7-day diet. On days 5, 6 and 7 mothers completed a Baby Day Diary. At baseline and at the end of the 7-day dietary intervention, breast milk was analysed for FODMAP content and infant faecal samples for pH.\nRESULTS\n\n\nEighteen breastfeeding mothers (aged 27-40 years) adhered (100%) to the low FODMAP diet. Infants were of gestational age 37-40.3 weeks and aged 2-17 weeks. At entry, crying durations were a mean [95% CI] of 142 [106-61] min and fell by 52 [178-120] min (P = 0.005; ancova). Combined crying-fussing durations fell by 73 [301-223] min (n = 13; P = 0.007), as did crying episodes (P = 0.01) and fussing durations (P = 0.011). Infant sleeping, feeding, or awake-and-content durations did not change. Infant faecal pH did not change. Breast milk lactose content was stable and other known FODMAPs were not detected.

We compared the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs with traditional dietary advice in a randomized controlled trial of patients with IBS.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe performed a multi-center, parallel, single-blind study of 75 patients who met Rome III criteria for IBS and were enrolled at gastroenterology outpatient clinics in Sweden. Subjects were randomly assigned to groups that ate specific diets for 4 weeks-a diet low in FODMAPs (n\u00a0= 38) or\u00a0a diet frequently recommended for patients with IBS (ie, a regular meal pattern; avoidance of large meals; and reduced intake of fat, insoluble fibers, caffeine, and gas-producing foods, such as beans, cabbage, and onions), with greater emphasis on how and when to eat rather than on what foods to ingest (n\u00a0= 37).

We report results from the first randomized controlled trial of the low FODMAP diet in US adults with IBS and diarrhea (IBS-D). The objectives were to compare the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet vs. a diet based upon modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines (mNICE) on overall and individual symptoms in IBS-D patients.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a single-center, randomized-controlled trial of adult patients with IBS-D (Rome III) which compared 2 diet interventions. After a 2-week screening period, eligible patients were randomized to a low FODMAP or mNICE diet for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief of IBS-D symptoms \u226550% of intervention weeks 3-4. Secondary outcomes included a composite end point which required response in both abdominal pain (\u226530% reduction in mean daily pain score compared with baseline) and stool consistency (decrease in mean daily Bristol Stool Form of \u22651 compared with baseline), abdominal pain and stool consistency responders, and other key individual IBS symptoms assessed using daily questionnaires.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAfter screening, 92 subjects (65 women, median age 42.6 years) were randomized. Eighty-four patients completed the study (45 low FODMAP, 39 mNICE). Baseline demographics, symptom severity, and nutrient intake were similar between groups. Fifty-two percent of the low FODMAP vs. 41% of the mNICE group reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms (P=0.31). Though there was no significant difference in the proportion of composite end point responders (P=0.13), the low FODMAP diet resulted in a higher proportion of abdominal pain responders compared with the mNICE group (51% vs. 23%, P=0.008). Compared with baseline scores, the low FODMAP diet led to greater reductions in average daily scores of abdominal pain, bloating, consistency, frequency, and urgency than the mNICE diet.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn this US trial, 40-50% of patients reported adequate relief of their IBS-D symptoms with the low FODMAP diet or a diet based on modified NICE guidelines. The low FODMAP diet led to significantly greater improvement in individual IBS symptoms, particularly pain and bloating, compared with the mNICE diet.",

Recently, the interest towards a diet approach has increased, for example, a diet with low content of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet and a specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) conducted for 3 months on symptoms and to evaluate the deficiencies of vitamin D and folic acid in patients affected by IBS, matching the Rome IV criteria.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe evaluated 73 patients divided into 2 groups: one submitted to low FODMAP diet and one to SCD, for 3 months. Patients were assigned to one of the 2 groups randomly and blinded. All the patients filled a visual analogue scale (VAS) to evaluate the severity of symptoms and a diary to evaluate the number of days with symptoms, and this was repeated after 3 months. Final evaluation was made by a blinded investigator.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn the end, the patients with low FODMAP diet had a significant improvement in bloating and distension ( P  = 0.000); the group with SCD instead had a low but not a significant improvement. One way ANOVA showed comparable severity of symptoms in the 2 groups pre-diet ( P  = 0.215), but a difference in the same symptoms after 12 days ( P  = 0.000). Tukey test showed a significant improvement in the low FODMAP diet group and only a trend of improvement in the second group of SCD. The vitamin D mean value in both groups at the time of enrollment was 38 ng/mL; in the end, the mean value in the low FODMAP diet group was 32 ng/mL and in the SCD group was 22 ng/mL, with a statistically significant difference. The folic acid mean value at the time of enrollment was 18 mg/dL; in the end, the mean value in the low FODMAP diet group was 15 mg/dL and in the SCD group was 8 mg/dL, with a statistically significant difference.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nPatients affected by IBS seem to have benefitted from a low FODMAP diet but not from an SCD, and a low FODMAP diet doesn't seem to cause vitamin D and folic acid deficiencies.",

The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of eliminating and subsequently reintroducing FODMAPs in patients with IBS symptoms as part of the IBD manifestation and to compare the severity of IBS symptoms and pain, bloating and quality of life (QoL). Methods: An eight-week randomised open-label FODMAP elimination with double-blinded, crossover provocations of FODMAP and placebo. Diet patients were on a low-FODMAP diet for eight weeks with blinded two-week provocations after two and six weeks. Questionnaires, blood and stool samples were collected. Results: Patient enrolment was challenging. Nineteen participants were included in the study. Eliminating low FODMAP for two weeks resulted in significant decreases in pain and bloating scores (p < 0.003), whereas there were no statistical differences in pain scores between diet patients and controls. Pain and bloating scores increased, returning to baseline levels after two weeks of double-blinded provocations with placebo, (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The results document the possibility of performing a randomised controlled study following the gold standard for testing food intolerance with blinding of the Low FODMAP diet.

We investigated the effects of a diet low in FODMAPs compared with an Australian diet, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial of patients with IBS.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn a study of 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy individuals (controls, matched for demographics and diet), we collected dietary data from subjects for 1 habitual week. Participants then randomly were assigned to groups that received 21 days of either a diet low in FODMAPs or a typical Australian diet, followed by a washout period of at least 21 days, before crossing over to the alternate diet. Daily symptoms were rated using a 0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale. Almost all food was provided during the interventional diet periods, with a goal of less than 0.5 g intake of FODMAPs per meal for the low-FODMAP diet. All stools were collected from days 17-21 and assessed for frequency, weight, water content, and King's Stool Chart rating.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSubjects with IBS had lower overall gastrointestinal symptom scores (22.8; 95% confidence interval, 16.7-28.8 mm) while on a diet low in FODMAPs, compared with the Australian diet (44.9; 95% confidence interval, 36.6-53.1 mm; P < .001) and the subjects' habitual diet. Bloating, pain, and passage of wind also were reduced while IBS patients were on the low-FODMAP diet. Symptoms were minimal and unaltered by either diet among controls. Patients of all IBS subtypes had greater satisfaction with stool consistency while on the low-FODMAP diet, but diarrhea-predominant IBS was the only subtype with altered fecal frequency and King's Stool Chart scores.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn a controlled, cross-over study of patients with IBS, a diet low in FODMAPs effectively reduced functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This high-quality evidence supports its use as a first-line therapy.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER\n\n\nACTRN12612001185853.",

A low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet is an established treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We have assessed the efficacy of a moderately low FODMAP diet on persistent symptoms in treated celiac patients.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA randomized controlled trial was performed from 2018 to 2019 in 70 adults with biopsy-proven celiac disease. Inclusion criteria were as follows: persistent gastrointestinal symptoms defined by a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)-IBS version score of 30 or higher, gluten-free diet adherence for 12 months or longer, and serologic and mucosal remission. Participants were randomized to a low FODMAP-gluten-free diet (intervention) or usual gluten-free diet (control). The GSRS-IBS score was recorded at baseline and at weeks 1 to 4, and the Celiac Symptom Index at baseline and at week 4. Statistics included marginal models for repeated data and analyses of covariance.\nRESULTS\n\n\nWe included 34 participants in the intervention group and 36 in the control group. Time development of GSRS-IBS total scores differed significantly between the groups (P interaction  < .001), evident after 1 week (mean difference in intervention vs control, -8.2; 95% CI, -11.5 to -5.0) and persisting through week 4 (mean difference in intervention vs control, -10.8; 95% CI, -14.8 to -6.8). Moreover, significantly lower scores were found for the dimensions of pain, bloating, diarrhea, and satiety (P interaction  \u2264 .04), but not constipation (P interaction \u00a0= .43). FODMAP intake during the intervention was moderately low (mean, 8.1 g/d; 95% CI, 6.7-9.3 g/d). The Celiac Symptom Index was significantly lower in the intervention group at week 4 (mean difference, -5.8; 95% CI, -9.6 to -2.0).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nA short-term moderately low FODMAP diet significantly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and increased celiac disease-specific health, and should be considered for the management of persistent symptoms in celiac disease.\nCLINICALTRIALS\n\n\ngov: NCT03678935.",

        "a10_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nThere are various studies showing the relationship between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and diet, and some dietary adjustments are recommended to reduce symptoms. In recent years, there is a growing number of studies that show a 4-8 wk low fermentable oligo, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAP) diet has a 50%-80% significant effect on symptoms in IBS patients. There is strong evidence suggesting that changes in fecal microbiota have an impact on IBS pathogenesis. Based on this argument, probiotics have been used in IBS treatment for a long time. As is seen, the FODMAP diet and probiotics are used separately in IBS treatment.\nAIM\n\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of adding probiotics to a low FODMAP diet to control the symptoms in patients with IBS.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThe patients who were admitted to the Gastroenterology Clinic of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital and diagnosed with IBS according to Rome IV criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomized into 2 groups each of which consisted of 50 patients. All patients were referred to a dietitian to receive dietary recommendations for the low FODMAP diet with a daily intake of 9 g. The patients were asked to keep a diary of foods and beverages they consumed. The patients in Group 1 were given supplementary food containing probiotics (2 g) once a day in addition to their low FODMAP diet, while the patients in Group 2 were given a placebo once a day in addition to their low FODMAP diet. Visual analogue scale (VAS), the Bristol Stool Scale and IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) scores were evaluated before and after the 21 d treatment.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe rate of adherence of 85 patients, who completed the study, to the FODMAP restricted diet was 92%, being 90% in Group 1 and 94% in Group 2. The mean scores of VAS and IBS-SSS of the patients in Group 1 before treatment were 4.6  \u00b1  2.7 and 310.0  \u00b1  78.4, respectively, and these scores decreased to 2.0  \u00b1  1.9 and 172.0  \u00b1  93.0 after treatment (both  P <  0.001). The mean VAS and IBS-SSS scores of the patients in Group 2 before treatment were 4.7  \u00b1  2.7 and 317.0  \u00b1  87.5, respectively, and these scores decreased to 1.8  \u00b1  2.0 and 175.0  \u00b1  97.7 after treatment (both  P <  0.001). The IBS-SSS score of 37 patients (86.04%) in Group 1 and 36 patients (85.71%) in Group 2 decreased by more than 50 points. Group 1 and Group 2 were similar in terms of differences in VAS and IBS-SSS scores before and after treatment. When changes in stool shape after treatment were compared using the Bristol Stool Scale, both groups showed significant change.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study is the randomized controlled study to examine the efficiency of probiotic supplementation to a low FODMAP diet in all subtypes of IBS. The low FODMAP diet has highly positive effects on symptoms of all subtypes of IBS. It was seen that adding probiotics to a low FODMAP diet does not make an additional contribution to symptom response and adherence to the diet.",

The study was aimed at comparing the effect of levothyroxine, administered alone or in combination with liothyronine, on sexual function and depressive symptoms in pre-menopausal women treated because of hypothyroidism. Methods This quasi-randomized, single-blind study included 39 young women receiving levothyroxine treatment who, despite thyrotropin and thyroid hormone levels within normal limits, still experienced clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism. These patients were divided into two groups: group A (n\u2009=\u200920) continued levothyroxine treatment, while group B (n\u2009=\u200919) received levothyroxine/liothyronine combination therapy. At the beginning of the study, and 6 months later, all participants of the study filled in questionnaires evaluating female sexual functioning (Female Sexual Function Index; FSFI) and the presence and severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition; BDI-II). Results The study was completed by 37 women. Baseline sexual functioning and depressive symptoms did not differ between the study groups. Neither the total FSFI score nor the domain scores changed throughout the study in women who continued levothyroxine treatment. Compared to levothyroxine administered alone, levothyroxine/liothyronine combination therapy increased scores for two domains: sexual desire and arousal, tended to increase the total FSFI score, as well as tended to decrease the overall BDI-II score. The effect of the combination therapy on sexual function correlated with a treatment-induced increase in serum levels of free triiodothyronine and testosterone. Conclusions The obtained results suggest that levothyroxine administered together with liothyronine is superior to levothyroxine administered alone in affecting female sexual functioning.",

Results from previous studies attempting to examine the comparative bioavailability of these formulations are difficult to interpret because of subject heterogeneity, single time-point blood sampling, varying degrees of hypothyroidism, and other factors. This study was devised to compare the rate and extent of absorption of LT4 from different LT4 sodium tablet formulations, in a simple model using a single-dose two-way single-blind, randomized cross-over design in 30 normal, healthy, nonpregnant, female subjects. This design controlled for many factors that limited previous LT4 bioavailability studies. Subjects were given a single 600 micrograms dose of LT4 as either Synthroid (Boots Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lincolnshire, IL) tablets (formulation A) or Levoxine tablets (Daniels Pharmaceuticals, St. Petersburg, FL; formulation B). Measurements of baseline-corrected total T4 serum concentrations determined at multiple time points demonstrated statistically significant differences between the two formulations at the 1.00, 3.00, 5.00, and 18.00 hour sampling times. Statistically significant differences for area under the curve (AUC) (0 to 48 hours) (formulation A, 159.9 +/- 9.4 micrograms-hour/dL; formulation B, 193.4 +/- 10.1 micrograms-hour/dL) and maximum peak plasma concentration (Cmax) (formulation A, 5.91 +/- .34; formulation B, 7.12 +/- .32) also were demonstrated. Furthermore, the ratio of the baseline-corrected total T4 concentrations (B/A x 100) were 120.9% for AUC and 120.5% for Cmax. These data demonstrate that the administration of Synthroid and Levoxine result in a significantly different rate and extent of absorption of LT4, and therefore these two formulations cannot be considered bioequivalent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The high-levonorgestrel group was treated with 2 mg estradiol valerate (days 1-21) sequentially combined with 0.25 mg levonorgestrel (days 12-21). The low-levonorgestrel group received the same estrogen regimen (2 mg estradiol valerate, days 1-21), but levonorgestrel was administered sequentially in a dose of 0.15 mg during the last 12 days of the cycle (days 10-21). Statistical analysis by Student's t-test for dependent variables (measured values versus baseline) and independent variables (differences between groups), and the composite t-test method for comparison of both regimens with respect to efficacy, was performed.\nRESULTS\n\n\nBoth groups were statistically comparable. The trial was completed by 137 subjects. Protocol violations occurred in 38 cases. Thirty-five subjects dropped out during the study, 21 of them because of adverse events. Both treatments were equally effective in the treatment of climacteric complaints. There were no clinically significant changes in body weight, blood pressure, haematological tests, and parameters of clinical chemistry. There was a tendency towards a reduction in bleeding intensity in both groups in the second half of the treatment period. The treatment for six cycles with both regimens significantly (P < 0.05) decreased plasma concentrations of triglycerides (significant in the low-levonorgestrel group only), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-3-cholesterol, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein A1. In parallel, the serum concentration of total cholesterol increased significantly in both treatment groups, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly in the high-levonorgestrel group only. The changes in high-density lipoprotein-2-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIt can be concluded that both sequential combined oral hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens were equivalent with respect to efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of women with climacteric complaints.

Sixty-two subjects were randomly assigned to receive Alesse (levonorgestrel 0.1 mg and EE 20 \u00b5g) or Loestrin Fe 1/20(R) (norethindrone acetate 1.0 mg and EE 20 \u00b5g).Results: At the time of the interim analysis data cut-off 32 subjects had completed 3 cycles of Alesse and 30 had completed 3 cycles of Loestrin Fe 1/20. The groups were similar with regard to age, weight, height, race, and prior OC usage. A total of 22% of the subjects in the levonorgestrel group and 27% of those subjects in the norethindrone group had never used OCs. The remainder had not used OCs for at least 3 months before entering the trial. During the third cycle of use, the percentage of normal cycles was significantly greater in the levonorgestrel group (P <.05). Moreover, the rate of intermenstrual bleeding (breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting) in the norethindrone group (62.9%) was more than double that in the levonoregestrel group (29.0%). Cumulatively, from cycles 1 to 3, there was a higher incidence of absence of withdrawal bleeding with norethindrone when compared with levonorgestrel (27.7% vs 5.3%).Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that good cycle control can be achieved with an OC containing 20 \u00b5g EE. The superior cycle control of Alesse compared with Loestrin Fe 1/20 is consistent with that found in comparative studies of the cycle control of levonorgestrel, norethindrone, and norethindrone acetate containing OCs that had a higher dose of EE.",

Delaying breakfast to take levothyroxine on an empty stomach can decrease adherence to hypothyroidism treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether administering levothyroxine with breakfast can maintain thyrotropin (TSH) levels in the therapeutic range, without major clinical changes.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA prospective, randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted to compare usual levothyroxine administration while in a fasting state with administration during breakfast. From September 2008 to April 2009, 45 patients with primary hypothyroidism who received levothyroxine were recruited. The patients completed 180 days of the protocol and were randomized to 90 days of each levothyroxine administration regimen (while fasting or with breakfast). Clinical and biochemical analyses were performed at baseline and on days 45, 90, 135, and 180. The primary outcome was TSH level.\nRESULTS\n\n\nForty-two patients completed the protocol. The TSH level was higher for levothyroxine administration with breakfast than while fasting (2.89 vs. 1.9 mIU/L, p=0.028). Uncontrolled hypothyroidism (TSH \u22653.5 mIU/L) occurred regardless of the type of levothyroxine administration (p=0.26). No risk factors were identified for TSH elevation.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nLevothyroxine administration with breakfast could be an alternative regimen for patients who have adherence difficulties due to the need for delaying intake, and is more likely to cause variability in the TSH level, meaning the patient should be followed more closely. For patients in whom a specific serum TSH goal is important, taking levothyroxine while fasting is recommended.",

Levothyroxine is often administered in the morning, on an empty stomach, to increase its absorption. However, many patients have trouble for taking levothyroxine in the morning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of changing administration time of levothyroxine from before breakfast to before dinner on serum levels of TSH and T4.\nMETHODS\n\n\nFifty hypothyroidism patients aged 18-75 years old were included in the study and randomly divided into two groups.

        "a3_doc": "Background:  Levothyroxine (LT4) sodium is a standard treatment for hypothyroidism. Its absorption and bioavailability when taken as a tablet have been shown to be significantly decreased with concomitant food ingestion. Therefore, LT4 formulations are recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30, ideally 60, minutes before breakfast, potentially affecting adherence to therapy. A novel LT4 solution (Tirosint \u00ae -SOL) has been shown to result in a faster absorption process than tablets or soft-gel capsule formulations. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the bioavailability of this preparation taken 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal in comparison with the minimally recommended 30-minute interval.  Methods:  Thirty-six (33 completers, 24 males and 9 females) healthy volunteers participating in the randomized study took 600 mcg of LT4 oral solution, single doses after a 10-hour fast, 15 or 30 minutes before a high-fat, high-calorie, FDA-approved standardized meal in a controlled research setting. We measured serum total thyroxine using Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry at baseline and multiple time points up to 72 hours after LT4 administration. The predefined equivalence boundaries for the extent of exposure reflected by the area under the curve (AUC) were 80-125%. The washout period was at least 35 days.  Results:  The geometric mean ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for the baseline-adjusted extent of exposure represented by AUCs truncated at both 48 and 72 hours after dosing (AUC 0-48 : 90% [90% CI 86-94]; and AUC 0-72 : 92% [90% CI 87-97]) were within the prespecified equivalence boundaries. The baseline-adjusted peak concentration was also clinically similar (C max : 85% [90% CI 80-90]). The median t max  was 1.5 hours in each group. The rate of adverse events was similar between groups.  Conclusions:  We observed no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic properties of a novel LT4 solution administered 15 and 30 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal in normal subjects. Further research is needed to evaluate (a) the differences in overall bioavailability at other time points (including immediately premeal) and (b) the real-world effectiveness of this preparation in newly proposed administration conditions to optimize treatment outcomes in hypothyroid patients.",

Current guidelines recommend that LT4 tablets be taken in a fasting state, but inability to adhere to this often leads to poor therapy compliance.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted in previously untreated hypothyroid patients randomly assigned to receive an oral solution of LT4 either at least 30 minutes before breakfast or directly at breakfast time. Each patient completed two six-week treatment periods, with different timing of active LT4 administration: placebo before breakfast and active LT4 at breakfast, or vice versa. At the end of each period, thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and free triiodothyronine (fT3) were measured. The primary endpoint was to verify any difference in serum TSH levels whether consuming liquid LT4 at breakfast or 30 minutes prior to breakfast.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 77 patients (64 females; median age 45.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7 years) completed the study. No statistically significant differences in serum TSH, fT4, or fT3 levels were observed whether LT4 was taken at breakfast or 30 minutes before, in a fasting state. No significant effect from the sequence of regimens, breakfast composition, and/or concomitantly administered drugs was observed on the dose of LT4 administered, or on the post-treatment serum TSH values.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe TICO study suggests that a liquid LT4 formulation can be ingested directly at breakfast, thus potentially improving therapeutic compliance. This observation is of considerable clinical relevance, since non-adherence to LT4 therapy requirements is more likely to cause variability in serum TSH concentrations.",

Objective of the study is to demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence of administering liquid L-T4 with breakfast or 10\u00a0min before breakfast. This was a pilot study conducted with a crossover design AB/BA where A stays for L-T4 with breakfast and B for L-T4 10\u00a0min before breakfast. A post hoc analysis was conducted to compare L-T4 administered at breakfast or 10\u00a0min before breakfast with L-T4 administered 30\u00a0min before breakfast. Sixty-one hypothyroid patients were enrolled and assigned to one of the two treatment sequences. All patients were evaluated for TSH levels at the end of each period. Fifty-nine patients completed the study. The mean thyrotropin concentration was 1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73 \u00b5U/ml when L-T4 was administered with breakfast and 1.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.81 \u00b5U/ml when it was taken 10\u00a0min before breakfast, without clinically and statistically significant differences (P\u00a0=\u00a00.59), regardless of treatment sequence and period.

To date, no large randomized trial investigating the best time of levothyroxine intake, including quality-of-life evaluation, has been performed.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTo ascertain if levothyroxine intake at bedtime instead of in the morning improves thyroid hormone levels, a randomized double-blind crossover trial was performed between April 1, 2007, and November 30, 2008, among 105 consecutive patients with primary hypothyroidism at Maasstad Hospital Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Patients were instructed during 6 months to take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime (one containing levothyroxine and the other a placebo), with a switch after 3 months. Primary outcome measures were thyroid hormone levels; secondary outcome measures were creatinine and lipid levels, body mass index, heart rate, and quality of life.\nRESULTS\n\n\nNinety patients completed the trial and were available for analysis. Compared with morning intake, direct treatment effects when levothyroxine was taken at bedtime were a decrease in thyrotropin level of 1.25 mIU/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.89 mIU/L; P < .001), an increase in free thyroxine level of 0.07 ng/dL (0.02-0.13 ng/dL; P = .01), and an increase in total triiodothyronine level of 6.5 ng/dL (0.9-12.1 ng/dL; P = .02) (to convert thyrotropin level to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0; free thyroxine level to picomoles per liter, multiply by 12.871; and total triiodothyronine level to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0154). Secondary outcomes, including quality-of-life questionnaires (36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 20-Item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and a symptoms questionnaire), showed no significant changes between morning vs bedtime intake of levothyroxine.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nLevothyroxine taken at bedtime significantly improved thyroid hormone levels.

Adult patients known to have primary hypothyroidism with stable TSH for the last 6 months who intended to fast during the month of Ramadan were invited to participate in this prospective study. The study took place during Ramadan of H1438 (May-June 2017). All patients were randomly assigned to two groups. In group A (n= 50) patients took levothyroxine 30 minutes before breaking the fast at sunset (iftar), and in group B (n= 46) patients took it 30 minutes before an early morning meal before sunrise (suhour).\nRESULTS\n\n\nTSH levels increased in both group A (from 1.99 to 3.28\u2009mIU/L) and group B (from 1.54 to 3.28\u2009mIU/L) after Ramadan fasting.

Properly testing alternative treatment regimens could therefore help to overcome treatment barriers. Hypothyroidism is a prevalent condition in older adults, however, studies evaluating L-thyroxine treatment effectiveness in this specific age group are still lacking. Most studies testing an evening administration of levothyroxine were mainly composed of younger adults. Therefore, this trial is aimed to assess if evening levothyroxine (LT4) administration can effectively control hypothyroidism in older patients.\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nA randomized crossover clinical trial was conducted between June 2018 and March 2020 at the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre, a teaching hospital in Brazil, to compare the efficacy of morning and evening administration of LT4 for hypothyroidism control in older patients. The study protocol is published elsewhere. A total of 201 participants, \u226560 years old, with primary hypothyroidism treated with LT4 for at least 6 months and on stable doses for at least 3 months were included. Participants were randomly assigned to a starting group of morning LT4 intake (60 min before breakfast) or bedtime LT4 intake (60 min after the last meal). After \u226512 weeks of follow-up, a crossover between strategies was performed. The primary outcome was the change in serum thyrotropin (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone; TSH) levels after 12 weeks of each LT4 administration regimen.\nResults\n\n\nA total of 201 participants with mean age of 72.4 \u00b1 7.2 years were included, out of which 84.1% were women; baseline characteristics and frequency of controlled hypothyroidism were similar between groups.

In study 2, 30 subjects with dandruff were treated for 3 weeks with a commercial ZPT shampoo (n = 15) or a vehicle (n = 15), and scalp lesional biopsies were collected at baseline and end of study for transcriptomic analysis. RNA was extracted from all biopsies and Affymetrix gene chips were used to analyse transcriptomic profiles, followed by bioinformatic analysis.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAnalysis of study 1 biopsies revealed more than 7000 individual probes differentially regulated in dandruff lesional skin relative to normal. Enriched Gene Ontology categories included: lipid metabolism, immune response, response to stimulus, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and epidermal development. The most striking feature of lesional skin relative to normal was the reciprocal expression of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes. Induced inflammatory genes were also enriched in dandruff uninvolved skin, suggesting the existence of predisposing factors associated with inflammation. Many genes increased in lesional skin were increased at the level of protein in stratum corneum samples (e.g. IL-1RA, S100A8, S100A9, S100A11, IL-8).

A comparative population without dandruff was also studied. Itch self-perception was quantified on a visual analogue scale. The histamine level in subjects with dandruff was more than twice that in those who did not have dandruff. Under conditions known to resolve flaking symptoms, the shampoo led to a reduction in histamine in subjects with dandruff to a level that was statistically indistinguishable from those who did not have dandruff.

The study consisted of three consecutive phases: a 2-week washout period, a 4-week treatment period and a 2-week post-treatment period. Patients were randomized equally to either the 1.5% ciclopirox olamine shampoo or 2% ketoconazole shampoo. An overall dandruff score was calculated using an area of dandruff involvement score and a severity score. Patients evaluated the presence of pruritus and also reported a global evaluation of efficacy.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn all, 57 patients successfully completed all three phases. The overall dandruff score declined progressively throughout the treatment period for both shampoos. A slight increase in pruritus was observed in the ciclopirox olamine treatment group during the post-treatment phase. Regarding global self-assessment of efficacy, both treatment groups were pleased with their scalp condition following treatment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nCiclopirox olamine shampoo appears to offer an effective, safe and easy to use treatment for mild to moderate dandruff.",

The work brings new information that, despite the presence of inflammation before surgery, patients with higher vitamin D levels had less inflammation, and this has been proven on three levels. We show that vitamin D levels clearly correlate with the severity of the disease in chronic sinusitis. These results have been confirmed in imaging studies (Lund MacKay scale), endoscopy (Lund-Kennedy scale) and in the SNOT 20 questionnaire. 40 patients suffering from chronic sinusitis were divided into two equal groups: group 1: with less severe radiological changes (10 or less points on the Lund-Mackay scale), group 2: with a more advanced form (>10 points). The relationship between VD3 and the severity of the disease (clinical and nasal endoscopy) was assessed. The mean VD3 level in patients in group 2 before surgery was lower (23.01 ng/mL) than in group 1 (28.02 ng/mL) ( p  < 0.05). They presented a higher degree of advanced changes in all the above scales, i.e., before the SNOT 20 procedure, the mean was: group 1: 30.33, group 2: 31.80 ( p  < NS); Lund-Kennedy: group 1: 3.21, group 2: 6.30 ( p  < 0.05).

Pain, evaluated through visual analog scale in the 3rd (A=2.0; IQR 1-6/B=4.5; IQR 2-6; p=0.18) and in the 7th (A=1.0; IQR 1.0-4.5/B=2.0; IQR 1.0-4.7; p=0.29) postoperative days, was not different between groups, as was the amount of analgesics administered. Dietary and physical activity patterns also showed no statistically significant differences between groups.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nDietary and activity restriction after adenotonsillectomy does not seem to affect patients' recovery. Such information may impact considerably on the social aspects that involve a tonsillectomy, reducing the working days lost by parents and accelerating the return of children to school.",

In both groups, patients were given endoscopic sinus surgery. On this basis, patients were treated with desloratadine citrate disodium in the EG. The total effective rate of the operation and the incidence of complications were compared between the two groups, and the VAS scores of clinical symptoms were compared between the two groups after treatment. Meanwhile, the changes of serum TIgE, ECP and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups, and the nasal mucociliary clearing function was compared between the two groups before and after treatment.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAfter treatment, the total effective rate was 94.9% in the EG, which was significantly higher than that in the CG (82.2%). The levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in the EG were significantly lower than those in the CG, and the levels of serum TIgE and ECP were also significantly lower than those in the CG. After treatment for 3 months, the mucociliary clearance rate and mucociliary clearance rate in the EG were significantly higher than those in the CG, while the saccharin clearance time was significantly shorter than that in the CG. The incidence of complications in the EG was significantly lower than that in the CG (all P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nDesloratadine citrate disodium combined with endoscopic sinus surgery can improve the clinical efficacy, reduce the level of inflammatory factors and effectively reduce the incidence of complications in patients with chronic sinusitis.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cold/liquid diet vs regular diet on posttonsillectomy pain and bleeding. Study Design Prospective randomized controlled trial. Setting Tertiary referral center. Subjects and Methods In total, 194 children who underwent tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) were randomly allocated into 2 groups. A total of 100 patients were allocated in the cold/liquid diet, and 94 patients were allocated in the regular diet group. Pain score was recorded for the first 7 days, and rate of hemorrhage was recorded for 10 days after surgery. Results The participants' age range was 3 to 17 years. The mean pain score level in the regular diet group after breakfast, lunch, and dinner was not statistically significant in comparison with the cold/liquid diet group. One patient in the regular diet group was admitted to the hospital due to secondary bleeding, but it stopped without any intervention. Conclusion Most otolaryngologists believe in dietary restrictions following tonsillectomy. However, there is much controversy regarding posttonsillectomy dietary advice in the literature. In addition, only a few randomized clinical trials have focused on this subject. We found that there was no difference between regular diet and cold/liquid diet in terms of posttonsillectomy pain and bleeding. Hence, we do not recommend a limited posttonsillectomy diet.",

Steroid therapy remains the most prevailing method of CRS treatment. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Aim: &lt;/b&gt;The aim of our study was to determine the clinical response to systemic and local steroid therapy in patients with CRSsNP depending on the total IgE antibody serum concentration. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 92 patients with CRSsNP took part in the study, where they were divided randomly into 2 groups. In group I, the patients received fluticasone propionate 800 mcg/day intranasally for 12 weeks. Patients in group II were treated with prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, given orally, for 7 consecutive days and continued by another week with decreasing dosage. Both groups were evaluated prior to and following treatment using the TSS score of CRS clinical symptoms, the endoscopic Lund-Kennedy scale and the Lund-Mackay CT staging of chronic rhinosinusitis. Statistical analy-sis of the effectiveness of treatment was carried out in subgroups according to the total IgE serum concentrations obtained before treatment. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Both groups of patients achieved statistically significant improvement in the TSS evaluation, as well as in endosco-pic and CT imaging findings. In patients with a total IgE serum concentration over 100 IU/ml systemic steroid therapy sho-wed significantly greater effect on the relief of CRS symptoms in the TSS score than intranasal steroid therapy. Analogous differences in the effectiveness of both methods were not found in patients with a normal total IgE serum concentration (&lt;100 IU/ml). &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; A short course of systemic steroid therapy is more effective than local treatment in relieving of CRS symptoms in patients with CRSsNP with elevated serum concentration of IgE antibodies. Atopy may be considered a specific predictor of response to steroid therapy in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.",

Clinical outcomes vary depending on the chosen therapy, resident microbiome and disease phenotype. We conducted a double- blinded, placebo-controlled Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to investigate effects of medical therapy on clinical outcomes and associated microbiome shifts.\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n\nFifty eligible patients (CRS with and without polyps) were treated for 3 weeks after randomisation into 3 arms: na- mely oral prednisolone, topical budesonide irrigations and oral doxycycline; each with appropriate placebo. Clinical scoring and microbiome swabs were performed on enrolment, at treatment completion and 3-weeks post treatment completion. Microbiome analysis was performed using the llumina-MiSeq next generation sequencing platform and QIME-2 pipeline.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSignificant improvement in clinical scores was observed in prednisolone and budesonide arms at treatment completion but not with antibiotic. Sub-group analysis showed more pronounced effects in patients with polyposis. Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus species predominated, with variable bacterial relative abundance among different treatments at all time-points. The only significant microbiome finding was an increase in bacterial diversity in topical budesonide group immediately after treatment, which returned to baseline 3-weeks post treatment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nClinical improvement was significant with oral and topical steroid but not empirical antibiotic. Although there were some associated microbiome changes with the various treatments, we could not ascertain the consistency of these and whether they do have a clinical significance at all.",

        "a1_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nThe vagus nerve has anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to investigate vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a new therapeutic strategy targeting an intrinsic anti-inflammatory pathway in a pilot study in Crohn's disease patients. The main objectives addressed the questions of long-term safety, tolerability, and anti-inflammatory effects of this therapy. This study is the continuation of previous reported findings at 6\u00a0months.\nMETHODS\n\n\nNine patients with moderate active disease underwent VNS. An electrode wrapped around the left cervical vagus nerve was continuously stimulated over 1\u00a0year. Clinical, biological, endoscopic parameters, cytokines (plasma, gut), and mucosal metabolites were followed-up.\nKEY RESULTS\n\n\nAfter 1\u00a0year of VNS, five patients were in clinical remission and six in endoscopic remission. C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin decreased in six and five patients, respectively. Seven patients restored their vagal tone and decreased their digestive pain score. The patients' cytokinergic profile evolved toward a more \"healthy profile\": Interleukins 6, 23, 12, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and transforming growth factor\u03b21 were the most impacted cytokines. Correlations were observed between CRP and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and some gut mucosa metabolites as taurine, lactate, alanine, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. VNS was well tolerated.\nCONCLUSION & INFERENCES\n\n\nVagus nerve stimulation appears as an innovative and well-tolerated treatment in moderate Crohn's disease. After 12\u00a0months, VNS has restored a homeostatic vagal tone and reduced the inflammatory state of the patients. VNS has probably a global modulatory effect on the immune system along with gut metabolic regulations. This pilot study needs replication in a larger randomized double-blinded control study.",

        "a2_doc": "Identifying patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) amenable to therapy is a challenge. To determine whether the amplitude of the sural sensory nerve action potential (sural SNAP) reflects the severity of DPN, an analysis was performed on 205 patients with DPN, identified by an abnormal vibration detection threshold (VDT), who were enrolled in a multinational clinical trial investigating ruboxistaurin (RBX) mesylate. Nerve conduction velocity and response amplitude and latency were measured and compared. VDT was significantly lower in those with preserved sural SNAPs (n = 128) than in those in whom they were absent (n = 77; 21.5 vs. 22.7 JND units, P = 0.002). Thus, preserved sural SNAP denoted less severe DPN. Logistic regression analyses evaluating baseline characteristics, HbA(1c), and baseline symptom scores identified only DPN duration as a factor that might contribute to the presence of sural SNAP (P = 0.004; OR = 0.896). For patients with abnormal VDT, preserved sural SNAP identifies a patient population with less severe DPN who may respond to therapeutic intervention in clinical trials.",

Diabetes control was good in both groups and there was no deterioration in either group during the course of the trial. Of the five neurophysiological parameters measured - the motor nerve compound action potential, motor nerve conduction velocity and minimum f wave latency of the common peroneal nerve and the sensory action potential and conduction velocity of the sural nerve - only the mean motor nerve action potential and conduction velocity increased though the changes were not significant. Four patients showed improvements of greater than 1.0 mV after treatment with Cronassial while none of the placebo group did so (p less than 0.05). Of the four patients who showed dramatic improvements in motor nerve action potentials, three also showed improvements in motor nerve conduction velocity. There were no significant changes in three tests of autonomic function after Cronassial therapy (orthostatic tilt reactions, single deep breath and Valsalva maneuver). Four patients in the Cronassial group (not those showing neurophysiological improvement) but only one in the placebo group reported marked improvements in their symptomatic complaints after treatment.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The main diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) outcome was assessed using clinical symptoms, signs, and nerve conduction study results during DCCT and repeated in EDIC year 13/14. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) was assessed by R-R response to paced breathing, Valsalva ratio, and blood pressure response to standing during DCCT and in EDIC years 13/14 and 16/17. Additionally, symptoms reflecting neuropathic pain and autonomic function (including hypoglycemia awareness) were collected yearly in EDIC using standardized questionnaires; peripheral neuropathy was also assessed annually using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. Assessments of genitourinary function were collected at EDIC year 10. RESULTS Intensive therapy during the DCCT significantly reduced the risk of DPN and CAN at DCCT closeout (64% and 45%, respectively, P < 0.01). The prevalence and incidence of DPN and CAN remained significantly lower in the DCCT intensive therapy group compared with the DCCT conventional therapy group through EDIC year 13/14. CONCLUSIONS The persistent effects of prior intensive therapy on neuropathy measures through 14 years of EDIC largely mirror those observed for other diabetes complications. DCCT/EDIC provides important information on the influence of glycemic control, and the clinical course of diabetic neuropathy, and, most important, on how to prevent neuropathy in type 1 diabetes.",

        "a6_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nCrohn's disease is a remitting and relapsing disorder that can affect the whole gastrointestinal tract. Active disease symptoms include abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhoea. There is no known cure; however, the disease can be managed, and therefore places a huge financial burden on healthcare systems. Abdominal pain is a common and debilitating symptom of Crohn's and other inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), and is multifaceted. Abdominal pain in Crohn's disease could be a symptom of disease relapse or related to medication adverse effects, surgical complications and strictures or adhesions secondary to IBD. In the absence of these factors, around 20 to 50% of people with Crohn's in remission still experience pain.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for managing abdominal pain in people with Crohn's disease and IBD (where data on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease could not be separated).\nSEARCH METHODS\n\n\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases, and clinical trials registries on 29 April 2021. We also searched the references of trials and systematic reviews for any additional trials.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\n\nAll published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised trials that compared interventions for the management of abdominal pain in the setting of Crohn's disease and IBD, with other active interventions or standard therapy, placebo, or no therapy were included. We excluded studies that did not report on any abdominal pain outcomes.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nFive review authors independently conducted data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment of the included studies. We analysed data using Review Manager 5. We expressed dichotomous and continuous outcomes as risk ratios and mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology.\nMAIN RESULTS\n\n\nWe included 14 studies (743 randomised participants). Five studies evaluated participants with Crohn's disease; seven studies evaluated participants with IBD where the data on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease could not be separated; and two studies provided separate results for Crohn's disease participants. Studies considered a range of disease activity states. Two studies provided intervention success definitions, whilst the remaining studies measured pain as a continuous outcome on a rating scale. All studies except one measured pain intensity, whilst three studies measured pain frequency. Withdrawals due to adverse events were directly or indirectly reported in 10 studies. No conclusions could be drawn about the efficacy of the majority of the interventions on pain intensity, pain frequency, and treatment success, except for the comparison of transcranial direct current stimulation to sham stimulation. The certainty of the evidence was very low in all but one comparison because of imprecision due to sparse data and risk of bias assessed as unclear or high risk. Two studies compared a low FODMAP diet (n=37) to a sham diet (n=45) in IBD patients. The evidence on pain intensity was of very low certainty (MD -12.00, 95% CI -114.55 to 90.55). One study reported pain intensity separately for CD participants in the low FODMAP group [n=14, mean(SD)=24 (82.3)] and the sham group [n=12, mean(SD)=32 (69.3)]. The same study also reported pain frequency for IBD participants in the low FODMAP group [n=27, mean(SD)=36 (26)] and sham group [n=25, mean(SD)=38(25)] and CD participants in the low FODMAP group [n=14, mean(SD)=36 (138.4)] and sham group [n=12, mean(SD)=48 (128.2)]. Treatment success was not reported. One study compared a low FODMAP diet (n=25) to high FODMAP/normal diet (n=25) in IBD patients. The data reported on pain intensity was unclear. Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared medicine-separated moxibustion combined with acupuncture (n=51) versus wheat bran-separated moxibustion combined with shallow acupuncture (n=51) in CD patients. The data reported on pain intensity and frequency were unclear. Treatment success was not reported. One study compared mindfulness with CBT (n=33) versus no treatment (n=33) in IBD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity and frequency (MD -37.00, 95% CI -87.29 to 13.29). Treatment success was not reported. One study compared soft non-manipulative osteopathic treatment (n=16) with no treatment besides doctor advice (n=14) in CD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity (MD 0.01, 95% CI -1.81 to 1.83). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared stress management (n=15) to self-directed stress management(n=15) and to standard treatment (n=15) in CD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these treatments on pain intensity (MD -30.50, 95% CI -58.45 to -2.55 and MD -34.30, 95% CI -61.99 to -6.61). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared enteric-release glyceryl trinitrate (n=34) with placebo (n=36) in CD patients. The data reported on pain intensity was unclear. Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported.\u00a0 One study compared 100 mg olorinab three times per day (n=8) with 25 mg olorinab three times per day (n=6) in CD patients. Pain intensity was measured as a 30% reduction in weekly average abdominal pain intensity score for the 100mg group (n=5) and the 25mg group (n=6). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared relaxation training (n=28) to a waitlist (n=28) in IBD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity\u00a0(MD -0.72, 95% CI -1.85 to 0.41). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared web-based education (n=30) with a book-based education (n=30) in IBD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity (MD -0.13, 95% CI -1.25 to 0.99). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared yoga (n=50) with no treatment (n=50) in IBD patients. The data reported on treatment success were unclear. Pain frequency and intensity were not reported. One study compared transcranial direct current stimulation (n = 10) to sham stimulation (n = 10) in IBD patients. There may be an improvement in pain intensity when transcranial direct current is compared to sham stimulation (MD -1.65, 95% CI -3.29 to -0.01, low-certainty evidence). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared a kefir diet (Lactobacillus bacteria) to no intervention in IBD patients and provided separate data for their CD participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity\u00a0in IBD (MD 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.07) and CD (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.53). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. Reporting of our secondary outcomes was inconsistent. The most adverse events were reported in the enteric-release glyceryl trinitrate and olorinab studies. \u00a0In the enteric-release glyceryl trinitrate study, the adverse events were higher in the intervention arm. In the olorinab study, more adverse events were observed in the higher dose arm of the intervention. \u00a0In the studies on non-drug interventions, adverse events tended to be very low or zero. However, no clear judgements regarding adverse events can be drawn for any interventions due to the low number of events. Anxiety and depression were measured and reported at the end of intervention in only one study; therefore, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn for this outcome.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe found low certainty evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation may improve pain intensity compared to sham stimulation. We could not reach any conclusions on the efficacy of any other interventions on pain intensity, pain frequency, and treatment success. The certainty of the evidence was very low due to the low numbers of studies and participants in each comparison and clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies. While no serious or total adverse events were elicited explicitly with any of the treatments studied, the reported events were very low. The certainty of the evidence for all comparisons was very low, so no conclusions can be drawn.",

Forty-nine patients without symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were randomized to either 3 months of treatment with C-peptide (600 nmol/24 h, four doses s.c.) or placebo. Forty-six patients (15 women and 31 men, aged 29 years, diabetes duration 10 years, and HbA(1c) 7.0%) completed the study. Neurological and neurophysiological measurements were performed before and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment.

Evidence to support these dietary interventions has been anecdotal. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of fat intake and solid/liquid meal consistency on symptoms in gastroparesis.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTwelve patients with gastroparesis were studied on four separate days receiving one of four meals each day in a randomized order: high-fat solid, high-fat liquid, low-fat liquid, and low-fat solid meal. At each visit, eight gastrointestinal symptoms were rated from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) every 15 min, before and for 4 h after meal ingestion.\nKEY RESULTS\n\n\nThere was an increase in the total symptom score in the following order: high-fat solid > low-fat solid > high-fat liquid > low-fat liquid. For the high-fat solid meal, symptoms remained elevated throughout the 4 h postprandial period. Severity of nausea more than doubled after the high-fat solid meal, whereas the low-fat liquid meal caused the least increase in nausea.\nCONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES\n\n\nA high-fat solid meal significantly increased overall symptoms among individuals with gastroparesis, whereas a low-fat liquid meal had the least effect. With respect to nausea, low-fat meals were better tolerated than high-fat meals, and liquid meals were better tolerated than solid meals. These data provide support for recommendations that low-fat and increased liquid content meals are best tolerated in patients with symptomatic gastroparesis.",

We performed a randomized trial of the ability of the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant to reduce symptoms in patients with chronic nausea and vomiting caused by gastroparesis or gastroparesis-like syndrome.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe conducted a 4-week multicenter, double-masked trial of 126 patients with at least moderate symptoms of chronic nausea and vomiting of presumed gastric origin for a minimum of 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given oral aprepitant (125 mg/day, n\u00a0= 63) or placebo (n\u00a0= 63). The primary outcome from the intention-to-treat analysis was reduction in nausea, defined as a decrease of 25 mm or more, or absolute level below 25 mm, on a daily patient-reported 0-to-100 visual analog scale (VAS) of nausea severity. We calculated relative risks of nausea improvement using stratified Cochran-Mental-Haenszel analysis.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAprepitant did not reduce symptoms of nausea, based on the primary outcome measure (46% reduction in the VAS score in the aprepitant group vs 40% reduction in the placebo group; relative risk, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7) (P\u00a0= .43). However, patients in the aprepitant group had significant changes in secondary outcomes such as reduction in symptom severity (measured by the 0-5 Gastroparesis Clinical Symptom Index) for nausea (1.8 vs 1.0; P\u00a0= .005), vomiting (1.6 vs 0.5; P\u00a0= .001), and overall symptoms (1.3 vs 0.7; P\u00a0= .001). Adverse events, predominantly mild or moderate in severity grade, were more common in aprepitant (22 of 63 patients, 35% vs 11 of 63, 17% in the placebo group) (P\u00a0= .04).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn a randomized trial of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting caused by gastroparesis or gastroparesis-like syndrome, aprepitant did not reduce the severity of nausea when reduction in VAS score was used as the primary outcome. However, aprepitant had varying effects on secondary outcomes of symptom improvement. These findings support the need to identify appropriate patient outcomes for trials of therapies for gastroparesis, including potential additional trials for aprepitant.

I've been dealing with reflux and gastritis since June of 2020 so I started taking omeprazole (which screwed up my stomach BIG TIME and I'm convinced is actually what ruined my body instead of my minor nighttime reflux I started taking it for). After months of dealing with that I tried dropping it for something else, but I started getting major heart palpitations and would wake up with my heart racing like 120-130bpm. It would keep happening throughout the day but all my doctors said it was anxiety (since I've had issues with that most of my life) but I know my body well enough to know the difference. I hopped onto 40mg pantoprazole and some daily anxiety meds from a psychiatrist which seemed to make the heart stuff go away at first and my stomach improved just from getting off the omeprazole, but I still havent been able to really eat and the 'correct foods' are still bothering me. Long story short, I've messed with my panto doses like 3 times and each time after a few days of either pausing it or cutting it in half I've had all the heart stuff come back, even with me still taking my anxiety meds. I did have a lot of testing done last year from my cardio (granted everything I did came after I got the meds so my heart had calmed down) which all came back normal, but when I ask my doctors about these side effects from stopping PPIs they all just kinda look at me, shrug, and say I'm a weird case and it's anxiety. I've got a new GI doc who seems nicer and wants to get me off them onto some famotidine, but in the process of weaning off getting there to try that I'm back to the same square of a constant racing heart and palpitations. It's been almost two weeks now and the only thing kinda keeping them in check is me taking my emergency panic attack meds. I've read stories about people having this kind of stuff happen WHILE they're taking it, but has anyone had any bad side effects getting off them like this? I kinda just need to know I'm not alone since my other doctors all point at each other in a circle and say 'ask that one'.",

If RAHS induces acid-related symptoms, this might lead to PPI dependency and thus have important implications.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 120 healthy volunteers was conducted. Participants were randomized to 12 weeks of placebo or 8 weeks of esomeprazole 40 mg/d followed by 4 weeks with placebo. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was filled out weekly. A score of >2 on 1 of the questions regarding heartburn, acid regurgitation, or dyspepsia was defined as a clinically relevant acid-related symptom.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were no significant differences between groups in GSRS scores at baseline. GSRS scores for acid-related symptoms were significantly higher in the PPI group at week 10 (1.4 +/- 1.4 vs 1.2 +/- 0.9; P = .023), week 11 (1.4 +/- 1.4 vs 1.2 +/- 0.9; P = .009), and week 12 (1.3 +/- 1.2 vs 1.0 +/- 0.3; P = .001). Forty-four percent (26/59) of those randomized to PPI reported > or = 1 relevant, acid-related symptom in weeks 9-12 compared with 15% (9/59; P < .001) in the placebo group. The proportion reporting dyspepsia, heartburn, or acid regurgitation in the PPI group was 13 of 59 (22%) at week 10, 13 of 59 (22%) at week 11, and 12 of 58 (21%) at week 12. Corresponding figures in the placebo group were 7% at week 10 (P = .034), 5% at week 11 (P = .013), and 2% at week 12 (P = .001).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nPPI therapy for 8 weeks induces acid-related symptoms in healthy volunteers after withdrawal.

The objective of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference in successfully discontinuing PPI use at 12 months between patients discontinuing abruptly or tapering first. Methodology We conducted a randomized trial with 38 patients diagnosed with GERD. We collected six weekly and then monthly surveys of symptoms based on the Dyspepsia Symptom Severity Index.

This study aimed to examine the clinical utility of prolonged wireless reflux monitoring to predict the ability to discontinue PPIs.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis double-blinded clinical trial performed over 3 years at 2 centers enrolled adults with troublesome esophageal symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and/or chest pain and inadequate PPI response. Participants underwent prolonged wireless reflux monitoring (off PPIs for \u22657 days) and a 3-week PPI cessation intervention. Primary outcome was tolerance of PPI cessation (discontinued or resumed PPIs). Symptom burden was quantified using the Reflux Symptom Questionnaire electronic Diary (RESQ-eD).\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 128 enrolled, 100 participants met inclusion criteria (mean age, 48.6 years; 41 men). Thirty-four participants (34%) discontinued PPIs. The strongest predictor of PPI discontinuation was number of days with acid exposure time (AET) > 4.0% (odds ratio, 1.82; P < .001).

In the intention-to-treat analysis, there were no differences in hospital mortality [PPI: 4.3% vs histamine-2 receptor blockers: 4.8%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.70], gastrointestinal bleeding (3.9% vs 4.8%, aOR 1.09, 95% CI 0.66-1.81), C. difficile infections (0.9% vs 0.1%, aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02-1.59), ventilator-associated conditions (1.6% vs 1.7%, aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-1.00) or median length of stay (9.2 vs 9.8 days, adjusted risk ratio 1.06, 85% CI 0.99-1.13). No significant treatment differences were observed among subgroups of interest or per-protocol populations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn a secondary analysis of cardiac surgery patients enrolled in the PEPTIC trial in Canada, no differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between use of PPIs and histamine-2 receptor blockers for stress ulcer prophylaxis.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\n\n\nanzctr.org.au identifier: ACTRN12616000481471.",

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of atypical manifestations in patients with acid reflux disease and the effect of PPI treatment. Patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of reflux were enrolled. Erosive esophagitis was stratified using the Los Angeles classification. Demographic data and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and included typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia), and atypical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, sialorrhea, hoarseness, globus sensation, chronic coughing, episodic bronchospasm, hiccup, eructations, laryngitis, and pharyngitis). Symptoms were reassessed after a 3-month course of b.i.d. PPI therapy. A total of 266 patients with a first diagnosis of GERD (erosive, 166; non-erosive, 100) were entered in the study. Presentation with atypical symptoms was approximately equal in those with erosive GERD and with non-erosive GERD, 72% vs 79% (P = 0.18). None of the study variables showed a significant association with the body mass index. PPI therapy resulted in complete symptom resolution in 69% (162/237) of the participants, 12% (28) had improved symptoms, and 20% (47) had minimal or no improvement. We conclude that atypical symptoms are frequent in patients with GERD. A trial of PPI therapy should be considered prior to referring these patients to specialists.",

To investigate the effect of a PPI in patients with symptom relapse without abnormal endoscopic findings.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSeventy-eight long-term primary care PPI users without verified indication for therapy discontinued treatment. In case of symptom recurrence, an endoscopy was performed. Patients without abnormal endoscopic findings were randomized to 7 days oesomeprazole 40\u2009mg once daily or placebo.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 11 of 78 (14%) patients discontinued the therapy successfully. Fifty-three of 78 patients (68%) experienced symptom recurrence. Thirty-one of 53 patients (59%) had a normal endoscopy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of PPI therapy for these symptoms after ER for ESCC.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe conducted a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial among 15 hospitals in Japan. In total, 229 patients with cT1a ESCC were randomly assigned to receive PPI therapy for 5\u00a0weeks after ER (the PPI group, n\u00a0=\u00a0115) or follow-up without PPI therapy (the non-PPI group, n\u00a0=\u00a0114). The primary end point was the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-like symptoms after ER from a self-reported questionnaire (Frequency Scale for Symptoms of GERD). Secondary end points were ulcer healing rate at 5\u00a0weeks, incidence of pain, improvement rate of symptoms in those who started PPI therapy because of GERD-like symptoms in the non-PPI group, and adverse events.\nRESULTS\n\n\nNo significant difference was observed in the incidence of GERD-like symptoms after ER between the non-PPI and PPI groups (30\u00a0% vs 34\u00a0%, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the ulcer healing rate at 5\u00a0weeks (84\u00a0% vs 85\u00a0%) and incidence of pain within 1\u00a0week (36\u00a0% vs 45\u00a0%). In nine of ten patients (90\u00a0%) who started PPI therapy because of GERD-like symptoms in the non-PPI group, PPI administration relieved GERD-like symptoms.

        "text": "PPI withdrawal heart side effects?\nI've been dealing with reflux and gastritis since June of 2020 so I started taking omeprazole (which screwed up my stomach BIG TIME and I'm convinced is actually what ruined my body instead of my minor nighttime reflux I started taking it for).\n\nAfter months of dealing with that I tried dropping it for something else, but I started getting major heart palpitations and would wake up with my heart racing like 120-130bpm. It would keep happening throughout the day but all my doctors said it was anxiety (since I've had issues with that most of my life) but I know my body well enough to know the difference.\n\nI hopped onto 40mg pantoprazole and some daily anxiety meds from a psychiatrist which seemed to make the heart stuff go away at first and my stomach improved just from getting off the omeprazole, but I still havent been able to really eat and the 'correct foods' are still bothering me. \n\nLong story short, I've messed with my panto doses like 3 times and each time after a few days of either pausing it or cutting it in half I've had all the heart stuff come back, even with me still taking my anxiety meds. I did have a lot of testing done last year from my cardio (granted everything I did came after I got the meds so my heart had calmed down) which all came back normal, but when I ask my doctors about these side effects from stopping PPIs they all just kinda look at me, shrug, and say I'm a weird case and it's anxiety.\n\nI've got a new GI doc who seems nicer and wants to get me off them onto some famotidine, but in the process of weaning off getting there to try that I'm back to the same square of a constant racing heart and palpitations. It's been almost two weeks now and the only thing kinda keeping them in check is me taking my emergency panic attack meds.\n\nI've read stories about people having this kind of stuff happen WHILE they're taking it, but has anyone had any bad side effects getting off them like this? I kinda just need to know I'm not alone since my other doctors all point at each other in a circle and say 'ask that one'.",

Bone mineral density, assessed in the distal part of the nondominant forearm using single photon absorptiometry, and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, assessed using a competitive protein binding assay, were measured before and after the period of dietary supplementation.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\n\nRelative change of bone mineral density.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSerum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased in 57% of patients who received a supplement (compared with 37% of control patients). Bone mineral density decreased significantly in control patients [median -7%, interquartile range -12.6-(+0.4%)] but not in patients who received a supplement [median -0.2%, interquartile range -3.8-(+14%); P < 0.005]. Increases in bone mineral density were especially prevalent among patients who received the supplement and had normal serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (68%), whereas increases occurred in only 18% of patients with low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P = 0.008). Patients without an intestinal resection and receiving the vitamin D supplement had a marginally greater increase in bone mineral content than patients who had undergone a resection (P = 0.05).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nLong-term oral vitamin D supplementation seems to be an efficient means of preventing bone loss in patients with Crohn's disease and could be recommended, especially for patients at high risk of osteoporosis.",

Vitamin D deficiency is common in approximately 57.7% of CD patients; with anaemia occurring in about 43% of patients. There is growing evidence that supplementing CD patients who are vitamin D deficient may be effective in reducing the severity of CD symptoms and reducing iron-deficiency anaemia. Nevertheless, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance regarding the management of CD does not address vitamin D deficiency in these patients. The aims of the study are (1) to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in adults with CD in Birmingham, UK and (2) to assess the feasibility of conducting a multi-site randomised controlled trial in adult patients with CD and vitamin D deficiency.\nMETHODS\n\n\nD-CODE consists of two parts-a screening study and an open-label randomised controlled feasibility study. 1. Vitamin D screening Three hundred patients, 18 years or older with CD will have a dried blood spot test to measure vitamin D levels. Dietary and sun exposure data will be collected. Eligible patients with low levels of vitamin D will be invited to participate in the feasibility study. 2. Feasibility study Fifty participants with CD and vitamin D deficiency will be randomised to receive either a low (400 IU daily for 24 weeks) or high (3200 IU daily for 12 weeks then vitamin D3 800 IU daily for 12 weeks) dose of vitamin D3 oral supplementation. Patient-reported outcomes (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L and Crohn's Disease Activity Index Score) will be collected at weeks 0 and 24. Biochemical monitoring will take place at weeks 0, 12 and 24 and will measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D, corrected calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, hepcidin, other vitamin D metabolites, iron studies and C-reactive protein. Faecal calprotectin will be measured at weeks 0 and 24.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nA key aspect of D-CODE is the identification of vitamin D deficiency prior to supplementation. It is hoped that this feasibility study will lead to a definitive trial that will investigate the benefits of treating vitamin D deficiency in patients with CD.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nThe trial has been registered with EudraCT number 2018-003910-42, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03718182 and ISRCTN number 15717783.",

Due to an increased risk of skin cancer, sun avoidance is advised, but this directly contributes to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. The simple solution is to advise vitamin D supplementation. The aim of this study was to examine the absolute and relative contribution of sunshine and supplementation to vitamin status. This study was a secondary analysis of an RCT of 92 Crohn's disease patients in remission (49% female, median age\u00a0=\u00a044). Participants were randomized to 2000\u00a0IU\u00a0day -1  of vitamin D3 or placebo for 1 year, with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) being measured at baseline and every 4\u00a0months. Based on participant's place of residence, daily ambient UVB dose at wavelengths that can induce vitamin D synthesis (D-UVB) was obtained. Cumulative and weighted ambient D-UVB (cw-D-UVB) exposure prior to each blood draw was calculated for each participant. Linear regression analysis and multilevel modeling were used to examine the association between UVB exposure, supplementation and 25(OH)D concentration. There was considerable annual variation in D-UVB, cw-D-UVB and 25(OH)D. Both supplementation and cw-D-UVB were found to be strongly associated with 25(OH)D: in multilevel model, an increase of approximately 6\u00a0nmol\u00a0L -1  for every 100\u00a0kJ\u00a0m -2  in cw-D-UVB was found, among those receiving placebo and supplementation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

The objective of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects of vitamin\u00a0D 3  supplementation (DS 3 ) in clinical active phase. A cohort of 262\u00a0CD patients and vitamin\u00a0D deficient (<\u00a050\u00a0nmol/L or <\u00a020\u00a0ng/mL) was randomized into 2\u00a0groups according to the DS 3  doses at 200,000\u00a0IU/month (D 200  group) versus 6,000\u00a0IU/day (D 6  group).

The purpose of this study was to describe the risk of seizure recurrence in children who achieved at least 1\u00a0month of seizure freedom on the KD, and to assess clinical features associated with sustained seizure freedom.\nMETHODS\n\n\nRecords of patients initiated on the KD at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) from 1991 to 2009 were reviewed. Subjects who attained seizure freedom for at least 1\u00a0month within 2\u00a0years were included in the study. Seizure frequency was recorded based on caregiver-reported seizure diaries as unchanged, improved, or worse compared to baseline. Those patients with seizure freedom \u22651\u00a0year were compared to those with seizure freedom <1\u00a0year in terms of demographics, age of seizure onset, number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) prior to KD, and epilepsy classification.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 276 patients initiated on the KD, 65 patients (24%) attained seizure freedom for a minimum of 1\u00a0month. The majority of these patients had daily seizures. The median time to seizure freedom after KD initiation was 1.5\u00a0months. Seizures recurred in 53 patients (82%), with a median time to seizure recurrence of 3\u00a0months. However, seizure frequency after initial recurrence remained far less than baseline. No clinical features were identified as risk factors for seizure recurrence.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nSeizure recurrence on the KD after 1\u00a0month of seizure freedom most often occurred as occasional breakthrough seizures and not a return to baseline seizure frequency. This study provides evidence to support the continued use of the KD in patients with initial seizure freedom even after breakthrough seizures.

        "a2_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nKetogenic diets (KDs) are high in fat and low in carbohydrates and have been suggested to reduce seizure frequency in people with epilepsy. Such diets may be beneficial for children with drug-resistant epilepsy. This is an update of a review first published in 2003, and last updated in 2018.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo assess the effects of ketogenic diets for people with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nSEARCH METHODS\n\n\nFor this update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 26 April 2019) on 29 April 2019. The Cochrane Register of Studies includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional relevant studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\n\nRCTs or quasi-RCTs of KDs for people of any age with drug-resistant epilepsy.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nTwo review authors independently applied predefined criteria to extract data and evaluated study quality. We assessed the outcomes: seizure freedom, seizure reduction (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency), adverse effects, cognition and behaviour, quality of life, and attrition rate. We incorporated a meta-analysis. We utilised an intention-to-treat (ITT) population for all primary analyses. We presented the results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nMAIN RESULTS\n\n\nWe identified 13 studies with 932 participants; 711 children (4 months to 18 years) and 221 adults (16 years and over). We assessed all 13 studies to be at high risk of performance and detection bias, due to lack of blinding. Assessments varied from low to high risk of bias for all other domains. We rated the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low certainty. Ketogenic diets versus usual care for children Seizure freedom (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.20 to 8.35; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 385 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and seizure reduction (RR 5.80, 95% CI 3.48 to 9.65; P < 0.001; 4 studies, 385 participants; low-certainty evidence) favoured KDs (including: classic KD, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) KD combined, MCT KD only, simplified modified Atkins diet (MAD) compared to usual care for children. We are not confident that these estimated effects are accurate. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea for both the intervention and usual care group, but the true effect could be substantially different (low-certainty evidence). Ketogenic diet versus usual care for adults In adults, no participants experienced seizure freedom. Seizure reduction favoured KDs (MAD only) over usual care but, again, we are not confident that the effect estimated is accurate (RR 5.03, 95% CI 0.26 to 97.68; P = 0.29; 2 studies, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adults receiving MAD most commonly reported vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea (very low-certainty evidence). One study reported a reduction in body mass index (BMI) plus increased cholesterol in the MAD group. The other reported weight loss. The true effect could be substantially different to that reported. Ketogenic diet versus ketogenic diet for children Up to 55% of children achieved seizure freedom with a classical 4:1 KD after three months whilst up to 85% of children achieved seizure reduction (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported a greater incidence of seizure reduction with gradual-onset KD, as opposed to fasting-onset KD. Up to 25% of children were seizure free with MAD and up to 60% achieved seizure reduction. Up to 25% of children became seizure free with MAD and up to 60% experienced seizure reduction. One study used a simplified MAD (sMAD) and reported that 15% of children gained seizure freedom rates and 56% achieved seizure reduction. We judged all the evidence described as very low certainty, thus we are very unsure whether the results are accurate. The most commonly reported adverse effects were vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea (5 studies, very low-certainty evidence). Two studies reported weight loss. One stated that weight loss and gastrointestinal disturbances were more frequent, with 4:1 versus 3:1 KD, whilst one reported no difference in weight loss with 20 mg/d versus 10 mg/d carbohydrates. In one study, there was a higher incidence of hypercalcuria amongst children receiving classic KD compared to MAD. All effects described are unlikely to be accurate. Ketogenic diet versus ketogenic diet for adults One study randomised 80 adults (aged 18 years and over) to either MAD plus KetoCal during the first month with MAD alone for the second month, or MAD alone for the first month followed by MAD plus KetoCal for the second month. No adults achieved seizure freedom. More adults achieved seizure reduction at one month with MAD alone (42.5%) compared to MAD plus KetoCal (32.5%), however, by three months only 10% of adults in both groups maintained seizure reduction. The evidence for both outcomes was of very low certainty; we are very uncertain whether the effects are accurate. Constipation was more frequently reported in the MAD plus KetoCal group (17.5%) compared to the MAD only group (5%) (1 study, very low-certainty evidence). Diarrhoea and increase/change in seizure pattern/semiology were also commonly reported (17.5% to 20% of participants). The true effects of the diets could be substantially different to that reported.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe evidence suggests that KDs could demonstrate effectiveness in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, however, the evidence for the use of KDs in adults remains uncertain. We identified a limited number of studies which all had small sample sizes. Due to the associated risk of bias and imprecision caused by small study populations, the evidence for the use of KDs was of low to very low certainty. More palatable but related diets, such as the MAD, may have a similar effect on seizure control as the classical KD, but could be associated with fewer adverse effects. This assumption requires more investigation. For people who have drug-resistant epilepsy or who are unsuitable for surgical intervention, KDs remain a valid option. Further research is required, particularly for adults with drug-resistant epilepsy.",

In a few patients, a 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalogram was obtained before and after diet initiation. We demonstrated the ability to manipulate the ketosis induced by fasting with the addition of glucose (dextrose) in 1 patient.\nINTERVENTIONS\n\n\nChildren fasted for 36 hours, and the diet was gradually introduced over 3 days. Parents were instructed to keep a baseline seizure frequency calendar for the month before the initiation of the diet. These calendars continued to be maintained as the diet was initiated.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\n\nSeizure decrease from baseline.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe atonic or myoclonic seizures decreased in these children by more than 50% immediately. Using a 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalogram, we documented that the seizures reported by a parent represent only a fraction of the electroclinical events; the technique could be used to measure the profound decrease in electrically documented seizures. Ketosis was eliminated with glucose, 60 g/d.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIt is feasible to evaluate the ketogenic diet's efficacy in atonic or myoclonic seizures in a blinded, crossover study. The diet can be manipulated on a short-term basis in a blinded manner, and ketosis can be achieved or eliminated.",

We found that the additional glucose did not significantly alter the frequency of electroencephalography-assessed events, but did decrease the frequency of parent-reported \"drop\" seizures (P = .07). Fasting had substantial effects on both seizures and electroencephalography-assessed events.

We therefore examined the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe performed a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with patients >16\u00a0years who had at least 3 seizures per month despite having tried at least 3 antiepileptic drugs. They were randomized to either 12\u00a0weeks on the modified Atkins diet (diet group) or habitual diet (control group). Primary endpoint was a change in seizure frequency from baseline to the intervention period, comparing those on diet with controls.\nRESULTS\n\n\nWe assigned 37 patients to the diet group and 38 to the control group. Nine of the patients in the diet group and 4 controls were excluded. Of those who completed the dietary intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a024), median seizure change was -1.0 (interquartile range [IQR] -13.7-8.8), while in the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a032) the median change was 4.5 (IQR -4.8-33.5). The median difference between the groups was -7.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] -37.0-3.0; P\u00a0=\u00a0.21). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the relative risk (RR) for achieving >50% seizure reduction was 1.8 (95% CI 0.3-10.2; P\u00a0=\u00a0.65), while for achieving >25% seizure reduction RR was 2.43 (95% CI 0.94-6.28; P\u00a0=\u00a0.06). We observed no serious adverse events.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nIn this RCT investigating the effect of an adjunctive modified Atkins diet on seizure frequency in adults with difficult-to-treat focal epilepsy, we found a significant reduction in seizure frequency in the diet group compared to the controls, but only for moderate benefit (>25% seizure reduction) among those who completed the intervention.

The authors showed that the ketogenic diet was superior to continuation of medical treatment in reducing seizure frequency in this patient population.

First, the ketogenic diet should be considered for the treatment of children with drug-resistant epilepsy and not only as a last resort. Second, the allocation of resources to support professionals in administering the ketogenic diet is justifiable.

The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in a randomised controlled trial.\nMETHODS\n\n\n145 children aged between 2 and 16 years who had at least daily seizures (or more than seven seizures per week), had failed to respond to at least two antiepileptic drugs, and had not been treated previously with the ketogenic diet participated in a randomised controlled trial of its efficacy to control seizures. Enrolment for the trial ran between December, 2001, and July, 2006. Children were seen at one of two hospital centres or a residential centre for young people with epilepsy. Children were randomly assigned to receive a ketogenic diet, either immediately or after a 3-month delay, with no other changes to treatment (control group). Neither the family nor investigators were blinded to the group assignment. Early withdrawals were recorded, and seizure frequency on the diet was assessed after 3 months and compared with that of the controls. The primary endpoint was a reduction in seizures; analysis was intention to treat. Tolerability of the diet was assessed by questionnaire at 3 months. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00564915.\nFINDINGS\n\n\n73 children were assigned to the ketogenic diet and 72 children to the control group. Data from 103 children were available for analysis: 54 on the ketogenic diet and 49 controls. Of those who did not complete the trial, 16 children did not receive their intervention, 16 did not provide adequate data, and ten withdrew from the treatment before the 3-month review, six because of intolerance. After 3 months, the mean percentage of baseline seizures was significantly lower in the diet group than in the controls (62.0%vs 136.9%, 75% decrease, 95% CI 42.4-107.4%; p<0.0001). 28 children (38%) in the diet group had greater than 50% seizure reduction compared with four (6%) controls (p<0.0001), and five children (7%) in the diet group had greater than 90% seizure reduction compared with no controls (p=0.0582). There was no significant difference in the efficacy of the treatment between symptomatic generalised or symptomatic focal syndromes. The most frequent side-effects reported at 3-month review were constipation, vomiting, lack of energy, and hunger.\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nThe results from this trial of the ketogenic diet support its use in children with treatment-intractable epilepsy.\nFUNDING\n\n\nHSA Charitable Trust; Smiths Charity; Scientific Hospital Supplies; Milk Development Council.",

A seizure diary record was used to compare seizure frequencies with the baseline prediet seizure frequency at the third and sixth months after diet therapy initiation.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFifty-one patients were assigned to the KD and 53 patients to the MAD. The KD group had a lower mean percentage of baseline seizures compared with the MAD group at 3 months (38.6% for KD, 47.9% for MAD) and 6 months (33.8% for KD, 44.6% for MAD), but the differences were not statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.1-50.8, p = 0.291 for 3 months; 95% CI 17.8-46.1, p = 0.255 for 6 months). Instead, for patients aged 1-2 years, seizure outcomes were consistently much more favorable in patients consuming the KD compared with those consuming the MAD. The rate of seizure freedom at 3 months after diet therapy initiation was significantly higher (53% for KD, 20% for MAD, p = 0.047) in these patients. The MAD had advantages with respect to better tolerability and fewer serious side effects.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nThe MAD might be considered as the primary choice for the treatment of intractable epilepsy in children, but the classic KD is more suitable as the first line of diet therapy in patients <2 years of age.",

While several therapeutic are currently recommended, including nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), molnupiravir, and remdesivir, these treatments have substantial drawbacks, including drug-drug interactions and questionable efficacy in vaccinated adults. Novel therapeutic options are urgently needed.\nEXPERT OPINION\n\n\nOn 28 December 2022, a phase 3, observer-blinded, randomized trial was published evaluating 771 symptomatic adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with a high risk of progression to severe disease. Participants were assigned to receive a 5-day course of either Paxlovid)\\, which is recommended by the World Health Organization for treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19, or VV116 and the primary end point was the time to sustained clinical recovery through day 28. Among study subjects, VV116 was found to be noninferior to Paxlovid with respect to the time to sustained clinical recovery and with fewer safety concerns.

We aimed to explore the potential benefit and safety of selectively blocking the anaphylatoxin and complement protein C5a with the monoclonal antibody IFX-1 (vilobelimab), in patients with severe COVID-19.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe did an exploratory, open-label, randomised phase 2 trial (part of the adaptive phase 2/3 PANAMO trial) of intravenous IFX-1 in adults with severe COVID-19 at three academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; severe pneumonia with pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, a clinical history of severe shortness of breath within the past 14 days, or a need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation; severe disease defined as a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) between 100 mm Hg and 250 mm Hg in the supine position; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IFX-1 (up to seven doses of 800 mg intravenously) plus best supportive care (IFX-1 group) or best supportive care only (control group). The primary outcome was the percentage change in PaO 2 /FiO 2  in the supine position between baseline and day 5. Mortality at 28 days and treatment-emergent and serious adverse events were key secondary outcomes. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in all patients according to treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04333420).\nFINDINGS\n\n\nBetween March 31 and April 24, 2020, 30 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the IFX-1 group (n=15) or the control group (n=15). During the study it became clear that several patients could not be assessed regularly in the supine position because of severe hypoxaemia. It was therefore decided to focus on all PaO 2 /FiO 2  assessments (irrespective of position). At day 5 after randomisation, the mean PaO 2 /FiO 2  (irrespective of position) was 158 mm Hg (SD 63; range 84-265) in the IFX-1 group and 189 mm Hg (89; 71-329) in the control group. Analyses of the least squares mean relative change in PaO 2 /FiO 2  at day 5 showed no differences between treatment groups (17% change in the IFX-1 group  vs  41% in the control group; difference -24% [95% CI -58 to 9], p=0\u00b715. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days were 13% (95% CI 0-31) for the IFX-1 group and 27% (4-49) for the control group (adjusted hazard ratio for death 0\u00b765 [95% CI 0\u00b710-4\u00b714]). The frequency of serious adverse events were similar between groups (nine [60%] in the IFX-1 group  vs  seven [47%] in the control group) and no deaths were considered related to treatment assignment. However, a smaller proportion of patients had pulmonary embolisms classed as serious in the IFX-1 group (two [13%]) than in the control group (six [40%]). Infections classed as serious were reported in three (20%) patients in the IFX-1 group versus five (33%) patients in the control group.\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nIn this small exploratory phase 2 part of the PANAMO trial, C5a inhibition with IFX-1 appears to be safe in patients with severe COVID-19. The secondary outcome results in favour of IFX-1 are preliminary because the study was not powered on these endpoints, but they support the investigation of C5a inhibition with IFX-1 in a phase 3 trial using 28-day mortality as the primary endpoint.\nFUNDING\n\n\nInflaRx.",

        "a6_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nMultiple vaccines have been approved since August 2021 to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, 20-40% of immunocompromised people fail to develop SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies after COVID-19 vaccination and remain at high risk of infection and more severe illness than non-immunocompromised hosts. Sotrovimab (VIR-7831) is a monoclonal neutralizing antibody that binds a conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It is neither renally excreted nor metabolized by P450 enzymes and therefore unlikely to interact with concomitant medications (e.g., immunosuppressive medications). In this open-label feasibility study protocol, we will define the optimal dose and dosing interval of sotrovimab as pre-exposure prophylaxis for immunocompromised individuals as well as its safety and tolerability in this population specifically.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe will enroll 93 eligible immunocompromised adults with a negative or low-positive (<\u200950 U/mL) SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. In phase 1, the first 10 patients will participate in a lead-in pharmacokinetics (PK) cohort study to determine the optimal dosing interval. Phase 2 will expand this population to 50 participants to examine rates of infusion-related reactions (IRR) with a 30-min 500\u00a0mg sotrovimab IV infusion. Phase 3 will be an expansion cohort for further assessment of the safety and tolerability of sotrovimab. In phase 4, the first 10 patients receiving 2000\u00a0mg IV of sotrovimab on the second sotrovimab infusion day will comprise a lead-in safety cohort that will inform the duration of observation following administration of the drug. The patients will be followed for safety and COVID-19 events for 36\u00a0weeks after the second dose.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nIn a previous phase III randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal trial, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of adverse events in patients receiving sotrovimab vs. placebo. Thus, we propose an open-label feasibility study protocol of sotrovimab as pre-exposure prophylaxis for immunocompromised individuals to evaluate its PK in immunocompromised individuals with impaired SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity and define optimal dosing intervals. We also aim to determine COVID-19 infections over the study period and self-reported quality of life measures throughout the study.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05210101.",

        "a7_doc": "Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID, is a multisystem complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection that continues to debilitate millions worldwide thus highlighting the public health importance of identifying effective therapeutics to alleviate this illness. One explanation behind PASC may be attributed to the recent discovery of persistent S1 protein subunit of SARS-CoV-2 in CD16+ monocytes up to 15 months after infection. CD16+ monocytes, which express both CCR5 and fractalkine receptors (CX3CR1), play a role in vascular homeostasis and endothelial immune surveillance. We propose targeting these receptors using the CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, along with pravastatin, a fractalkine inhibitor, could disrupt the monocytic-endothelial-platelet axis that may be central to the etiology of PASC. Using five validated clinical scales (NYHA, MRC Dyspnea, COMPASS-31, modified Rankin, and Fatigue Severity Score) to measure 18 participants' response to treatment, we observed significant clinical improvement in 6 to 12 weeks on a combination of maraviroc 300 mg per oral twice a day and pravastatin 10 mg per oral daily. Subjective neurological, autonomic, respiratory, cardiac and fatigue symptoms scores all decreased which correlated with statistically significant decreases in vascular markers sCD40L and VEGF. These findings suggest that by interrupting the monocytic-endothelial-platelet axis, maraviroc and pravastatin may restore the immune dysregulation observed in PASC and could be potential therapeutic options. This sets the framework for a future double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial to further investigate the drug efficacy of maraviroc and pravastatin in treating PASC.",

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of intravenous methylprednisolone compared with intravenous immunoglobulins.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis is an open-label, multicentre, two-arm RCT done at ten hospitals in Switzerland in children younger than 18 years hospitalised with PIMS-TS (defined as age <18 years; fever and biochemical evidence of inflammation, and single or multiorgan dysfunction; microbiologically proven or putative contact with SARS-CoV-2; and exclusion of any other probable disease). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg per day for 3 days) or intravenous immunoglobulins (2 g/kg as a single dose). The primary outcome was length of hospital stay censored at day 28, death, or discharge. Secondary outcomes included proportion and duration of organ support. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat. The study was registered with Swiss National Clinical Trials Portal (SNCTP000004720) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04826588).\nFINDINGS\n\n\nBetween May 21, 2021, and April 15, 2022, 75 patients with a median age of 9\u00b71 years (IQR 6\u00b72-12\u00b72) were included in the intention-to-treat population (37 in the methylprednisolone group and 38 in the intravenous immunoglobulins group). The median length of hospital stay was 6\u00b70 days (IQR 4\u00b70-8\u00b70) in the methylprednisolone group and 6\u00b70 days (IQR 5\u00b70-8\u00b78) in the intravenous immunoglobulins group (estimated effect size -0\u00b7037 of the log 10  transformed times, 95% CI -0\u00b713 to 0\u00b7065, p=0\u00b742). Fewer patients in the methylprednisolone group (ten [27%] of 37) required respiratory support compared with the intravenous immunoglobulin group (21 [55%] of 38, p=0\u00b7025). Need and duration of inotropes, admission to intensive care units, cardiac events after baseline, and major bleeding and thrombotic events were not significantly different between the study groups.\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nIn this RCT, treatment with methylprednisolone in children with PIMS-TS did not significantly affect the length of hospital stay compared with intravenous immunoglobulins. Intravenous methylprednisolone could be an acceptable first-line treatment in children with PIMS-TS.\nFUNDING\n\n\nNOMIS Foundation, Vontobel Foundation, and Gaydoul Foundation.",

        "a9_doc": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\nSome COVID-19 patients evolve to severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome triggered by both the coronavirus infection and the subsequent host-immune response. Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients.\nMETHODS\n\n\nand analysis: TACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42 patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature \u226437.5\u00a0\u00b0C, and PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate \u226424\u00a0rpm; for 48 consecutive hours.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nMethylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm. Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing countries.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\n\n\nNCT04341038 / EudraCT: 2020-001445-39.",

        "a10_doc": "Inosine pranobex (IP), an immunomodulatory agent, is used in the treatment of various viral infections. The results of a phase 3 randomized controlled trial are reported, evaluating the efficacy and safety of IP in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. It includes 416 symptomatic patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to a defined standard of care, patients \u00a0randomly (1:1) receive either IP 500\u00a0mg tablet (IP group) or a matching placebo (placebo group) at 50\u00a0mg kg -1  body weight/day rounded to the nearest 500\u00a0mg dose (maximum 4\u00a0g day -1 ) administered in 3-4 divided doses for 10 days. Compared to the placebo group, IP group shows significantly higher rates of clinical response (CR) and clinical cure (CC) on Day-6 for both non-hospitalized patients\u00a0and the total population. IP group shows significantly earlier CR and CC with fewer adverse events and no mortality. Based on these findings and the fact that IP increases natural killer\u00a0cell-mediated cytotoxicity of virus-infected cells as an early immune response to viral infection and enhances NKG2D ligand expression, it is concluded that IP should be started early to maximize the benefit in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.

I contacted my PCP and neuro who said that as soon as I test positive they would recommend getting me on Paxlovid as long as we can find it (vs monoclonal antibody infusions, as apparently those are not working quite as effectively against Omicron). Ive been doing my research on the drug but am curious if anyone has taken it yet. What was your experience? The worst side effect she mentioned was like a battery acid taste in your mouth for the entire 5-day regimen. Sounds gross but doable. \n\nThanks in advance for any insight.",

        "a1_doc": "WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE\n\n\nTietze syndrome is a rare form of chest wall costochondritis with joint swelling which can cause significant chest pain and decline in ability of daily activities. There is no standardized treatment protocol. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of adding oral steroids in addition to other non- steroidal treatment in improvement of pain and quality of life (QOL) in patients with Tietze syndrome.\nMETHODS\n\n\nForty patients with Tietze syndrome were randomly divided into two treatment groups: (1) One week of prednisolone 40\u2009mg daily followed by 1\u2009week of prednisolone 20\u2009mg daily followed by 1\u2009week of 10\u2009mg with 3\u2009weeks of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a020); (2) three weeks of NSAID treatment only (n\u00a0=\u00a020). A symptom questionnaire was used to rate the major symptoms of Tietze syndrome and costochondritis: Numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (severest pain); the resulting global symptom score was used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with assessment of joint swelling resolution. The EQ-5D-5L instrument for measurement of QOL was used. Assessments were made on intention to treat basis at baseline and at 1, 2 and 3\u2009weeks followed by a medium term follow period after treatment cessation. The trial was registered at www.isrctn.com ISRCTN11877533.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nThere was a significant drop in mean NRS pain scores between the groups at 1, 2 and 3\u2009weeks in favour of the steroid group (46.8% vs. 17.7%; p\u2009<\u20090.001, 56.3% vs. 35.8% p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 65.4% vs. 46.7% p\u2009<\u20090.001 respectively). There was a 25.8% (95% CI 13.2-38.8) difference in mean NRS score drop at a median of 6.5\u2009months after treatment cessation in favour of the steroid group over the NSAID only group. Only three cases of mild GIT upset in the steroid group and two cases of mild nausea were reported in the NSAID group. There was an improvement in QOL using the median EQ-5D-5L scoring at 3\u2009weeks in favour of the steroid group 7 (7, 8) versus 10 (8.5-11), (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The improvement in pain scoring and QOL did not correlate with improvement in joint swelling at 3\u2009weeks after treatment with 2/20 (10%) in the steroid arm versus 1/20 (5%) in NSAID arm having an obvious improvement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.393).\nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION\n\n\nIn this study, addition of short-term oral corticosteroids showed a clear benefit for use at 1, 2 and 3\u2009weeks in improvement of pain and QOL in patients with Tietze syndrome. This difference was maintained at mid-term follow up after treatment cessation. This facilitates the advantage of using steroids as well as excluding their side effects for an accepted timeframe.",

        "a4_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nFrom May 2020 to January 2021, we enrolled 1233 health care workers (HCW) from Danish Hospitals in a randomized trial evaluating whether Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) provides protection against COVID-19. Participants were randomized 1:1 to BCG vs saline and followed for 6\u00a0months. From December 2020, Covid-19 vaccines were offered to the HCW. In most cases, BCG vaccination results in a characteristic scar. Reactivation of the BCG scar has been described in children during viral infections and following influenza vaccination, but is mostly associated to Kawasaki's disease, a disease entity with pathogenesis likely similar to the child Covid-19 complication MIS-C: Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome. Reactivation of scars after neonatal BCG vaccination has recently been described in four women after Covid-19 mRNA vaccination. Two of our trial participants experienced reactivation of their novel BCG scars after receiving mRNA Covid-19 vaccination 6 to 8\u00a0months post-BCG.\nCASE PRESENTATIONS\n\n\nTwo female HCW participants that had been randomly allocated to BCG in the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial, spontaneously reported itching and secretion at the BCG scar site after having received mRNA Covid-19 vaccination (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) 6 to 8\u00a0months following inclusion and BCG vaccination. One participant, who had a larger BCG skin reaction, noticed re-appearing symptoms after both the first and the second COVID-vaccine dose, while the other participant only noted symptoms after the second dose. Both had been BCG vaccinated during childhood, and no reactivation was noted in the older scars. No treatment was needed or provided.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe reactivation of the BCG scar after receiving mRNA vaccine might have been caused by cross-reactivity between BCG and SARS-CoV-2. In both cases, the symptoms were bothersome, but self-limiting and left no sequelae. The risk of reactivation at the scar site is thus not a reason to avoid vaccination with either vaccine.",

Although vaccine implementation is more effective when deployed as soon as possible, vaccine hesitancy is a significant threat to the success of vaccination programs.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a communication tool for patients with underlying medical conditions who should decide whether to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis 3-arm prospective randomized controlled trial will test the effect of the developed communication intervention, which is fully automated, patient decision aid (SMART-DA), and user-centered information (SMART-DA-\u03b1). The web-based intervention was developed to help decision-making regarding COVID-19 vaccination among patients with underlying medical conditions.

Secondary outcomes included uveitis activity and best-corrected visual acuity at 3 months.\nResults\n\n\nOf the 543 participants (304 women [56.0%]; median age, 35 [IQR, 26-49] years), 262 were recommended for early vaccination and 281 for deferred vaccination. By month 3, 109 patients (41.6%) in the early group had been vaccinated compared with 14 (5.0%) in the deferred recommendation group.

        "a7_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nRegional pain in the hip in adults is a common cause of a general practitioner visit. A considerable part of patients suffer from (greater) trochanteric pain syndrome or trochanteric bursitis. Local corticosteroid injections is one of the treatment options. Although clear evidence is lacking, small observational studies suggest that this treatment is effective in the short-term follow-up. So far, there are no randomised controlled trials available evaluating the efficacy of injection therapy. This study will investigate the efficacy of local corticosteroid injections in the trochanter syndrome in the general practice, using a randomised controlled trial design. The cost effectiveness of the corticosteroid injection therapy will also be assessed. Secondly, the role of co-morbidity in relation to the efficacy of local corticosteroid injections will be investigated.\nMETHODS/DESIGN\n\n\nThis study is a pragmatic, open label randomised trial. A total of 150 patients (age 18-80 years) visiting the general practitioner with complaints suggestive of trochanteric pain syndrome will be allocated to receive local corticosteroid injections or to receive usual care. Usual care consists of analgesics as needed. The randomisation is stratified for yes or no co-morbidity of low back pain, osteoarthritis of the hip, or both. The treatment will be evaluated by means of questionnaires at several time points within one year, with the 3 month and 1 year evaluation of pain and recovery as primary outcome. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes will be made according to the intention-to-treat principle. Direct and indirect costs will be assessed by questionnaires. The cost effectiveness will be estimated using the following ratio: CE ratio = (cost of injection therapy minus cost of usual care)/(effect of injection therapy minus effect of usual care).\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThis study design is appropriate to estimate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the injection therapy. We choose to use a pragmatic study design and are thus not able to study specific effects of the injection with corticosteroids. A distinction between placebo effect of the injection and specific effects of the corticosteroids is therefore not possible.",

Thus, we aimed to assess the effects of withholding methotrexate for 2 weeks after each dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine (MIVAC I) or only after the second dose of vaccine (MIVAC II) compared with continuation of methotrexate, in terms of post-vaccination antibody titres and disease flare rates.\nMethods\n\n\nMIVAC I and II were two parallel, independent, assessor-masked, randomised trials. The trials were done at a single centre (Dr Shenoy's Centre for Arthritis and Rheumatism Excellence; Kochi, India) in people with either rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis with stable disease activity, who had been on a fixed dose of methotrexate for the preceding 6 weeks. Those with previous COVID-19 or who were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies were excluded from the trials. People on high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab were also excluded, whereas other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were allowed. In MIVAC I, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to stop methotrexate treatment for 2 weeks after each vaccine dose or to continue methotrexate treatment. In MIVAC II, participants who had continued methotrexate during the first dose of vaccine were randomly assigned (1:1) to withhold methotrexate for 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine or to continue to take methotrexate. The treating physician was masked to the group assignments. The primary outcome for both MIVAC I and MIVAC II was the titre (absolute value) of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody measured 4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. All analyses were done per protocol. The trials were registered with the Clinical Trials Registry- India, number CTRI/2021/07/034639 (MIVAC I) and CTRI/2021/07/035307 (MIVAC II).\nFindings\n\n\nBetween July 6 and Dec 15, 2021, participants were recruited to the trials. In MIVAC I, 250 participants were randomly assigned and 158 completed the study as per the protocol (80 in the methotrexate hold group and 78 in the control group; 148 [94%] were women and 10 [6%] were men). The median post-vaccination antibody titres in the methotrexate hold group were significantly higher compared with the control group (2484\u00b70 IU/mL, IQR 1050\u00b70-4388\u00b78  vs  1147\u00b75 IU/mL, 433\u00b75-2360\u00b73; p=0\u00b70014). In MIVAC II, 178 participants were randomly assigned and 157 completed the study per protocol (76 in the methotrexate hold group and 81 in the control group; 135 [86%] were women and 22 [14%] were men). The methotrexate hold group had higher post-vaccination antibody titres compared with the control group (2553\u00b75 IU/ml, IQR 1792\u00b75-4823\u00b78  vs  990\u00b75, 356\u00b71-2252\u00b75; p<0\u00b70001). There were no reports of any serious adverse events during the trial period.\nInterpretation\n\n\nWithholding methotrexate after both ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine doses and after only the second dose led to higher anti-RBD antibody titres compared with continuation of methotrexate. However, withholding methotrexate only after the second vaccine dose resulted in a similar humoral response to holding methotrexate after both vaccine doses, without an increased risk of arthritis flares. Hence, interruption of methotrexate during the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine appears to be a safe and effective strategy to improve the antibody response in patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis.\nFunding\n\n\nIndian Rheumatology Association.",

The number of patients who had concerns about the triggering of a vaccine-induced HAE attack or about the possible vaccine adverse effects was higher in group 2 (n = 26 [100%]) than in group 1 (n = 74 [64.9%]).  Conclusion:  It seems that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase HAE attacks regardless of the type of the vaccines. We recommend that HAE activity should be under control before COVID-19 vaccination, and the patients should be well informed about the safety of the vaccines.",

More anifrolumab-treated patients had improved arthritis by SLEDAI-2K versus placebo: 55/97 (56.7%) versus 42/99 (42.4%), OR (90% \u2009CI) 1.88 (1.16 to 3.04), p=0.032; \u2009and BILAG: 65/94 (69.1%) versus 47/95 (49.5%), OR (90% CI) 2.47 (1.48 to 4.12), p=0.003; and mean (SD) swollen and tender joint reductions: -5.5 (6.3) versus -3.4 (5.9), p=0.004. Comparable results were demonstrated in IFNGS test-high patients (n=151). In IFNGS test-low patients (n=50), substantial numerical differences in partial rash and arthritis responses were observed in anifrolumab-treated patients versus placebo, with statistical significance only for rash by BILAG in this small population.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAnifrolumab treatment was associated with improvements versus placebo in specific SLE features of arthritis and rash using measures of different stringency. Although driven by robust data in the prevalent IFNGS test-high population, further evaluation in IFNGS test-low patients is warranted.",

        "a2_doc": "Although sunscreens are widely used to photoprotect patients with photosensitive lupus erythematosus (LE), standardized controlled studies that can prove their efficacy for this indication have been lacking. Therefore, in the present study, the capacity of three different, commercially available sunscreens to prevent the development of skin lesions that have been induced in LE patients under standardized, reproducible conditions by employing a provocative phototest was assessed. In a double blind, intraindividual comparative study, 11 patients with LE were photoprovoked according to a standard protocol. All patients developed LE-specific skin lesions upon photoprovocation with a combination of UVA plus UVB radiation. Each of the sunscreens tested prevented the development of skin lesions in this assay, but to various extents. Suncreen A (UVB: Octocrylene; UVA: Mexoryl SX, Mexoryl XL, Parsol 1789; TiO2) was by far the most effective by protecting in 11/11 patients. This protective capacity was corroborated by studies in which strong ICAM-1 mRNA expression was found in unprotected test areas, but not in sunscreen A pretreated sites. In contrast to sunscreen A, sunscreen B (UVB: Eusolex 6300, Parsol MCX, Uvinul T150, Neohelipan; UVA: Parsol 1789; TiO2) protected in 5 patients and sunscreen C (Eusolex 6300, Parsol MCX, Uvinul T150; UVA: Parsol 1789; TiO2) in 3 out of 11 patients. These studies indicate that the use of sunscreens is beneficial to LE patients because it can prevent the development of UV radiation-induced skin lesions. Effective protection, however, might vary considerably between different sunscreens.",

The test product and its vehicle were applied 15 minutes before UVA and UVB irradiation of uninvolved skin areas on the upper aspect of the back in a random order, and standardized phototesting was performed daily for 3 consecutive days.\nRESULTS\n\n\nCharacteristic skin lesions were induced by UVA and UVB irradiation in 16 patients with CLE in the untreated area, and 14 patients showed a positive test result in the vehicle-treated area. In contrast, no eruptions compatible with CLE were observed in the sunscreen-treated area in any of the 25 patients. This resulted in significant differences (P < .001) between UV-irradiated sunscreen-treated versus vehicle-treated areas, and between UV-irradiated sunscreen-treated versus untreated areas. Furthermore, a significant difference (P < .05) was observed concerning the age of disease onset and the patient history of photosensitivity. Patients who were younger than 40 years at onset of CLE reported photosensitivity significantly more often than patients with a higher age of disease onset. None of the patients showed any adverse events from application of the test product or the vehicle.\nLIMITATIONS\n\n\nData resulting from standardized experimental phototesting might not be transferable to a clinical setting.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThese results indicate clearly that the use of a highly protective broad-spectrum sunscreen can prevent skin lesions in photosensitive patients with different subtypes of CLE.",

All drugs had a similar appearance to avoid identification. Both groups received broad-spectrum sunscreens twice a day and the prednisone dose was kept stable during the study. Cutaneous lesions were evaluated by 2 blinded observers at baseline and at months 1, 2, 4, and 6.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThirty-three patients were randomized to a treatment group, of whom 27 completed 6 months of treatment. The groups were homogeneous and comparable in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics. Five CFZ-treated patients and 1 CDP-treated patient (P = 0.15) dropped out due to development of severe lupus flare. At the end of the study, 12 CFZ-treated patients (75%) and 14 CDP-treated patients (82.4%) had complete or near-complete remission of skin lesions; intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant difference in the response rates between groups. Side effects, mainly skin and gastrointestinal events, were frequent in both groups, but no patients had to discontinue their treatment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThese findings suggest that CFZ is equally as effective as CDP in controlling cutaneous lesions in SLE patients.

        "a5_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic form of cutaneous lupus, which can cause scarring. Many drugs have been used to treat this disease and some (such as thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) are potentially toxic. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2009. We wanted to update the review to assess whether any new information was available to treat DLE, as we were still unsure of the effectiveness of available drugs and how to select the most appropriate treatment for an individual with DLE.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo assess the effects of drugs for discoid lupus erythematosus.\nSEARCH METHODS\n\n\nWe updated our searches of the following databases to 22 September 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We also searched five trials databases, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. Index Medicus (1956 to 1966) was handsearched and we approached authors for information about unpublished trials.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\n\nWe included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs to treat people with DLE in any population group and of either gender. Comparisons included any drug used for DLE against either another drug or against placebo cream. We excluded laser treatment, surgery, phototherapy, other forms of physical therapy, and photoprotection as we did not consider them drug treatments.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nAt least two reviewers independently extracted data onto a data extraction sheet, resolving disagreements by discussion. We used standard methods to assess risk of bias, as expected by Cochrane.\nMAIN RESULTS\n\n\nFive trials involving 197 participants were included. Three new trials were included in this update. None of the five trials were of high quality.'Risk of bias' assessments identified potential sources of bias in each study. One study used an inappropriate randomisation method, and incomplete outcome data were a concern in another as 15 people did not complete the trial. We found most of the trials to be at low risk in terms of blinding, but three of the five did not describe allocation concealment.The included trials inadequately addressed the primary outcome measures of this review (percentage with complete resolution of skin lesions, percentage with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions, and improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures).One study of fluocinonide cream 0.05% (potent steroid) compared with hydrocortisone cream 1% (low-potency steroid) in 78 people reported complete resolution of skin lesions in 27% (10/37) of participants in the fluocinonide cream group and in 10% (4/41) in the hydrocortisone group, giving a 17% absolute benefit in favour of fluocinonide (risk ratio (RR) 2.77, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.08, 1 study, n = 78, low-quality evidence). The other primary outcome measures were not reported. Adverse events did not require discontinuation of the drug. Skin irritation occurred in three people using hydrocortisone, and one person developed acne. Burning occurred in two people using fluocinonide (moderate-quality evidence).A comparative trial of two oral agents, acitretin (50 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily), reported two of the outcomes of interest: complete resolution was seen in 13 of 28 participants (46%) on acitretin and 15 of 30 participants (50%) on hydoxychloroquine (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.59, 1 study, n = 58, low-quality evidence). Clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions was reported in 10 of 24 participants (42%) on acitretin and 17 of 25 (68%) on hydroxychloroquine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.06, 1 study, n = 49, low-quality evidence). This comparison did not assess improvement in patient satisfaction/quality of life measures. Participants taking acitretin showed a small increase in serum triglyceride, not sufficient to require withdrawal of the drug. The main adverse effects were dry lips (93% of the acitretin group and 20% of the hydroxychloroquine group) and gastrointestinal disturbance (11% of the acitretin group and 17% of the hydroxychloroquine group). Four participants on acitretin withdrew due to gastrointestinal events or dry lips (moderate-quality evidence).One trial randomised 10 people with DLE to apply a calcineurin inhibitor, pimecrolimus 1% cream, or a potent steroid, betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% cream, for eight weeks. The study reported none of the primary outcome measures, nor did it present data on adverse events.A trial of calcineurin inhibitors compared tacrolimus cream 0.1% with placebo (vehicle) over 12 weeks in 14 people, but reported none of our primary outcome measures. In the tacrolimus group, five participants complained of slight burning and itching, and for one participant, a herpes simplex infection was reactivated (moderate-quality evidence).Topical R-salbutamol 0.5% cream was compared with placebo (vehicle) over eight weeks in one trial of 37 people with DLE. There was a significant improvement in pain and itch in the salbutamol group at two, four, six, and eight weeks compared to placebo, but the trial did not record a formal measure of quality of life. None of the primary outcome measures were reported. Changes in erythema did not show benefit of salbutamol over placebo, but we could not obtain from the trial report the number of participants with clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions. There were 15 events in the placebo group (experienced by 12 participants) and 24 in the salbutamol group (experienced by nine participants). None of the adverse events were considered serious (moderate-quality evidence).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nFluocinonide cream may be more effective than hydrocortisone in clearing DLE skin lesions. Hydroxychloroquine and acitretin appear to be of equal efficacy in terms of complete resolution, although adverse effects might be more frequent with acitretin, and clearing of erythema in at least 50% of lesions occurred less often in participants applying acitretin. Moderate-quality evidence found adverse events were minor on the whole. There is not enough reliable evidence about other drugs used to treat DLE. Overall, the quality of the trials and levels of uncertainty were such that there is a need for further trials of sufficient duration comparing, in particular, topical steroids with other agents.",

Baseline and annual ANA results were collected along with information on drug toxicity and reasons for discontinuation of treatment.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOver five years 24 patients stopped taking SSZ and 49 AUR because of side effects. Of the features common to SLE, rash developed in nine SSZ patients and 11 AUR treated patients and mouth ulcers in three and four patients respectively. Six SSZ treated patients and three treated with AUR developed leucopenia, which promptly resolved with drug withdrawal. No adverse event was ascribed to drug induced SLE. Of the 72 SSZ treated patients who were ANA negative or weakly positive at outset, 14 (19%) became strongly ANA positive compared with 11 (14%) of 80 AUR patients. Patients ANA positive at baseline or who became ANA positive were not more likely to develop drug toxicity or to withdraw from treatment than those ANA negative throughout.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nANA positivity is common in patients with RA, but the presence or development of ANA did not increase the likelihood of withdrawing from treatment.

Prednisone (30 mg/day or equivalent) was given for 1 month, and then the dosage was tapered. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with new flare (adjudicated) according to a score of A/B on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index after the start of the steroid taper.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 118 patients were randomized to receive abatacept and 57 to receive placebo. The baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. The proportion of new BILAG A/B flares over 12 months was 79.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 72.4, 86.9) in the abatacept group and 82.5% (95% CI 72.6, 92.3) in the placebo group (treatment difference -3.5 [95% CI -15.3, 8.3]). Other prespecified flare end points were not met. In post hoc analyses, the proportions of abatacept-treated and placebo-treated patients with a BILAG A flare were 40.7% (95% CI 31.8, 49.5) versus 54.4% (95% CI 41.5, 67.3), and the proportions with physician-assessed flare were 63.6% (95% CI 54.9, 72.2) and 82.5% (95% CI 72.6, 92.3), respectively; treatment differences were greatest in the polyarthritis group. Prespecified exploratory patient-reported outcomes (Short Form 36 health survey, sleep problems, fatigue) demonstrated a treatment effect with abatacept. The frequency of adverse events (AEs) was comparable in the abatacept and placebo groups (90.9% versus 91.5%), but serious AEs (SAEs) were higher in the abatacept group (19.8 versus 6.8%). Most SAEs were single, disease-related events occurring during the first 6 months of the study (including the steroid taper period).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAlthough the primary/secondary end points were not met in this study, improvements in certain exploratory measures suggest some abatacept efficacy in patients with non-life-threatening manifestations of SLE.

The TRUST trial included adults aged 65 years or older diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as the presence of persistently elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (4.6-19.9 mIU/L) with free thyroxine (T4) within the reference range. Participants were identified from clinical and general practitioner laboratory databases and recruited from the community in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and the UK. This ancillary study included a subgroup of 472 participants from the Netherlands and Switzerland; after exclusions, a total of 427 participants (211 randomized to levothyroxine and 216 to placebo) were analyzed. This analysis was conducted from December 1, 2019, to September 1, 2020.\nInterventions\n\n\nRandomization to either levothyroxine or placebo.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\n\nDepressive symptom scores after 12 months measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms (minimal clinically important difference\u2009=\u20092).\nResults\n\n\nA total of 427 participants with subclinical hypothyroidism (mean [SD] age, 74.52 [6.29] years; 239 women [56%]) were included in this analysis. The mean (SD) TSH level was 6.57 (2.22) mIU/L at baseline and decreased after 12 months to 3.83 (2.29) mIU/L in the levothyroxine group; in the placebo group, it decreased from 6.55 (2.04) mIU/L to 5.91 (2.66) mIU/L. At baseline, the mean (SD) GDS-15 score was 1.26 (1.85) in the levothyroxine group and 0.96 (1.58) in the placebo group. The mean (SD) GDS-15 score at 12 months was 1.39 (2.13) in the levothyroxine and 1.07 (1.67) in the placebo group with an adjusted between-group difference of 0.15 for levothyroxine vs placebo (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.46; P\u2009=\u2009.33). In a subgroup analysis including participants with a GDS-15 of at least 2, the adjusted between-group difference was 0.61 (95% CI, -0.32 to 1.53; P\u2009=\u2009.20). Results did not differ according to age, sex, or TSH levels. A previous meta-analysis (N\u2009=\u2009278) on the association of levothyroxine with depressive symptoms was updated to include these findings, resulting in an overall standardized mean difference of 0.09 (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.22).\nConclusions and Relevance\n\n\nThis ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial found that depressive symptoms did not differ after levothyroxine therapy compared with placebo after 12 months; thus, these results do not provide evidence in favor of levothyroxine therapy in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism to reduce the risk of developing depressive symptoms.\nTrial Registration\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01853579.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of levothyroxine treatment on depressive symptoms in subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed. Sixty subjects (51 females and 9 males) with subclinical hypothyroidism were enrolled. Beck Depression Inventory was completed for all participants at the beginning of the study and 12 weeks after enrollment. The intervention and control groups received levothyroxine and placebo, respectively, for 12 weeks. There were no statistical differences in the total depression score and its subscales between the two groups at the beginning of the study. The Beck Depression Inventory score decreased from 16.79\u2009\u00b1\u200913.25 to 12.37\u2009\u00b1\u200910.01 (p value\u2009=\u20090.04) in the intervention group.

A pilot study showed that levothyroxine intake at bedtime significantly decreased thyrotropin levels and increased free thyroxine and total triiodothyronine levels. To date, no large randomized trial investigating the best time of levothyroxine intake, including quality-of-life evaluation, has been performed.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTo ascertain if levothyroxine intake at bedtime instead of in the morning improves thyroid hormone levels, a randomized double-blind crossover trial was performed between April 1, 2007, and November 30, 2008, among 105 consecutive patients with primary hypothyroidism at Maasstad Hospital Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Patients were instructed during 6 months to take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule at bedtime (one containing levothyroxine and the other a placebo), with a switch after 3 months. Primary outcome measures were thyroid hormone levels; secondary outcome measures were creatinine and lipid levels, body mass index, heart rate, and quality of life.\nRESULTS\n\n\nNinety patients completed the trial and were available for analysis. Compared with morning intake, direct treatment effects when levothyroxine was taken at bedtime were a decrease in thyrotropin level of 1.25 mIU/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.89 mIU/L; P < .001), an increase in free thyroxine level of 0.07 ng/dL (0.02-0.13 ng/dL; P = .01), and an increase in total triiodothyronine level of 6.5 ng/dL (0.9-12.1 ng/dL; P = .02) (to convert thyrotropin level to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0; free thyroxine level to picomoles per liter, multiply by 12.871; and total triiodothyronine level to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0154). Secondary outcomes, including quality-of-life questionnaires (36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 20-Item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and a symptoms questionnaire), showed no significant changes between morning vs bedtime intake of levothyroxine.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nLevothyroxine taken at bedtime significantly improved thyroid hormone levels. Quality-of-life variables and plasma lipid levels showed no significant changes with bedtime vs morning intake. Clinicians should consider prescribing levothyroxine intake at bedtime.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nisrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN17436693 (NTR959).",

At baseline, all patients exhibited a rapid cycling pattern and were evaluated prospectively through at least one affective episode. Levothyroxine was added to the baseline medication regimen, and the dosage was increased until clinical response occurred or until side effects precluded further increase. While patients were taking levothyroxine, scores on both depressive and manic symptom rating scales decreased significantly compared with baseline. This improvement was due to the clear-cut response of depressive symptoms in 10 of 11 patients, with manic symptoms responding in five of the seven patients who exhibited them during baseline evaluation. Four patients then underwent single- or double-blind placebo substitution; three patients relapsed into either depression or cycling. Treatment response did not depend on previous thyroid status. In 9 of 10 responsive patients, supranormal circulating levels of free thyroxine were necessary to induce clinical response. Side effects were minimal, and there were no signs or symptoms of levothyroxine-induced hypermetabolism.",

Data from a randomized clinical trial were combined with a subgroup of participants aged 80 years and older from a second clinical trial. The trials were conducted between April 2013 and May 2018. Final follow-up was May 4, 2018.\nEXPOSURES\n\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned to receive levothyroxine (n\u2009=\u2009112; 52 participants from the first trial and 60 from the second trial) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009139; 53 participants from the first trial and 86 from the second trial).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\n\n\nCo-primary outcomes were Thyroid-Related Quality of Life Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO) questionnaire scores for the domains of hypothyroid symptoms and tiredness at 1 year (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate worse quality of life; minimal clinically important difference, 9).\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 251 participants (mean age, 85 years; 118 [47%] women), 105 were included from the first clinical trial and 146 were included from the second clinical trial.

However, it is unclear whether increasing LT4 dose confers additional mood benefits.\nDESIGN AND PATIENTS\n\n\nA single-blinded before-and-after study of 24 patients with hypothyroidism who were aged 65\u00a0years or older and undergoing LT4 replacement therapy with stable doses.\nMEASUREMENTS\n\n\nGeriatric Depression Scale (GDS-K) and Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale (HSS-K) were assessed at baseline, 3\u00a0months after increasing LT4 dose by an additional 12.5\u00a0\u00b5g/d, and finally 3\u00a0months after returning to the baseline dose.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSerum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations decreased at the higher LT4 dose (1.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.16 vs 0.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.09\u00a0mIU/L, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and recovered after returning to the baseline dose. Serum-free thyroxine levels and HSS-K scores were unchanged during the study period. GDS-K scores improved on the increased dose (9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 vs 7.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7, P\u00a0=\u00a0.029), and this improvement was maintained after returning to the baseline dose (9.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 vs 7.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4, P\u00a0=\u00a0.010). Higher serum TSH was independently associated with both higher GDS-K and depression risk among those with depressive mood (GDS-K\u00a0>\u00a010) at baseline.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nDepressive mood improves with increased LT4 dose, without significant hyperthyroid symptoms or signs, in older adults undergoing thyroid hormone replacement. These findings suggest the potential for varying the treatment target for hypothyroidism based on mood status and that low-dose LT4 treatment might be an ancillary treatment for depression.",

        "a9_doc": "Background\n\n\nThe brain is a critical target organ for thyroid hormone, but it is unclear whether variations in thyroid function within and near the reference range affect quality of life, mood, or cognition.\nMethods\n\n\nA total of 138 subjects with levothyroxine (L-T4)-treated hypothyroidism and normal thyrotropin (TSH) levels underwent measures of quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Underactive Thyroid-Dependent Quality of Life Questionnaire), mood (Profile of Mood States, Affective Lability Scale), and cognition (executive function, memory). They were then randomly assigned to receive an unchanged, higher, or lower L-T4 dose in double-blind fashion, targeting one of three TSH ranges (0.34 to 2.50, 2.51 to 5.60, or 5.61 to 12.0 mU/L). Doses were adjusted every 6 weeks based on TSH levels. Baseline measures were reassessed at 6 months.\nResults\n\n\nAt the end of the study, by intention to treat, mean L-T4 doses were 1.50 \u00b1 0.07, 1.32 \u00b1 0.07, and 0.78 \u00b1 0.08 \u03bcg/kg (P < 0.001), and mean TSH levels were 1.85 \u00b1 0.25, 3.93 \u00b1 0.38, and 9.49 \u00b1 0.80 mU/L (P < 0.001), respectively, in the three arms. There were minor differences in a few outcomes between the three arms, which were no longer significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Subjects could not ascertain how their L-T4 doses had been adjusted (P = 0.55) but preferred L-T4 doses they perceived to be higher (P < 0.001).\nConclusions\n\n\nAltering L-T4 doses in hypothyroid subjects to vary TSH levels in and near the reference range does not affect quality of life, mood, or cognition. L-T4-treated subjects prefer perceived higher L-T4 doses despite a lack of objective benefit.

        "a1_doc": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\nDespite optimal medical therapy and endoscopic sinus surgery there still remains a group of unfortunate patients suffering from exacerbations of recalcitrant chronic sinusitis. We have performed a pilot study in order to determine whether nebulized topical antibiotic therapy improves sinusitis symptoms more than saline-based placebo in patients with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\n\n\nA randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over pilot study was conducted in 14 patients with recalcitrant CRS. Nasal irrigation with bacitracin/colimycin or placebo using the RhinoFlow nebulizer twice daily was administered in combination with oral levofloxacin. Severity of a diversity of symptoms was measured using the VAS score, a Disease-Specific Symptom Score and the SF-36 questionnaire. Nasal endoscopic findings were also assessed.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFor most VAS items and Disease-Specific Symptom Scores, a reduction in severity of symptoms was noted in both the bacitracin/colimycin and the placebo group. No significant difference was found between the 2 arms (bacitracin/colimycin vs. placebo). Most SF-36 items improved, compared with the situation before treatment in both groups. However no significant difference was found between the verum and placebo arm. Endoscopic findings did not reveal significant differences when comparing the 2 treatments.\nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\n\n\nThe outcome of this study suggests a beneficial effect of nebulizing the nose with saline. This study again shows that adding antibiotics to local saline is not effective. Although the placebo-controlled studies looking at the effect of local antibiotics are all small they all point to the same direction: no effect. Definite conclusions however need a large randomized, multicenter study.",

Patients aged under 18 years, history of granulomatous diseases, immunosuppression, invasive fungal sinusitis, and pregnant ladies were excluded from the study. The ratio was kept as 1:2; one receiving irrigation with amphotericin B and the other only saline nasal irrigation without the medicine. After surgery, the patients were divided into two groups; 58 patients were in the placebo group and 29 in the amphotericin group. Serum IgE levels were documented before and one month postoperative treatment. Serum IgE level of more than 250 ng/ml was taken as a high value. All the patients were followed for six months. Recurrence was defined as the recurrence of nasal symptoms and recurrence of mucosal thickening based on repeat CT scan. Frequency tables and cross tabulations using Chi-square test were performed with p-values of 0.05 taken as significant were performed on different variables.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 87 patients were inducted. Overall 22 (25.3%) patients had recurrence of symptoms at six-month followup visit. Twelve (13.7%) of these were in the placebo group and 10 (11.5%) were in the amphotericin B nasal irrigation group. Serum IgE level preoperatively ranged between 52 - 9344 ng/dl; postoperatively it ranged from 13-1050 ng/dl. When pre and postoperative serum IgE level were compared with each other and CT scan scores, using Chi-square test, the difference was significant (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAmphotericin B improved the CT scan score of the patients. The nasal irrigation of amphotericin B did not show significant change in the recurrence pattern of chronic sinuses with polyps. Serum IgE can be used as marker for the presence and response to treatment for non-invasive fungal sinusitis.",

        "a5_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nThis review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection in the short term (and some to reduce inflammation in the long term), in order to normalise nasal mucus and improve symptoms.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.\nSEARCH METHODS\n\n\nThe Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\n\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo or (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nWe used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) and anaphylaxis or other very serious reactions. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.\nMAIN RESULTS\n\n\nWe included five RCTs (293 participants), all of which compared systemic antibiotics with placebo or another pharmacological intervention.The varying study characteristics made comparison difficult. Four studies recruited only adults and one only children. Three used macrolide, one tetracycline and one a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Three recruited only patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, one recruited patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and one had a mixed population. Three followed up patients for 10 to 12 weeks after treatment had finished. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo Three studies compared antibiotics with placebo (176 participants).One study (64 participants, without polyps) reported disease-specific HRQL using the SNOT-20 (0 to 5, 0 = best quality of life). At the end of treatment (three months) the SNOT-20 score was lower in the group receiving macrolide antibiotics than the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.10), corresponding to a moderate effect size favouring antibiotics (moderate quality evidence). Three months after treatment, it is uncertain if there was a difference between groups.One study (33 participants, with polyps) provided information on gastrointestinal disturbances and suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) after a short course of tetracycline antibiotic compared with placebo. We are very uncertain if antibiotics were associated with an increase in gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.50) or skin irritation (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 128.86) (very low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids One study (60 participants, some with and some without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with placebo; all participants also used saline irrigation and 70% used intranasal corticosteroids. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using SNOT-22 (0 to 110, 0 = best quality of life). Data were difficult to interpret (highly skewed and baseline imbalances) and it is unclear if there was an important difference at any time point (low quality evidence). To assess patient-reported disease severity participants rated the effect of treatment on a five-point scale (-2 for \"desperately worse\" to 2 for \"cured\") at the end of treatment (three months). For improvement in symptoms there was no difference between the antibiotics and placebo groups; the RR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.79; very low quality evidence), although there were also slightly more people who felt worse after treatment in the antibiotics group. There was no demonstrable difference in the rate of gastrointestinal disturbances between the groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10). General HRQL was measured using the SF-36. The authors stated that there was no difference between groups at the end of treatment (12 weeks) or two weeks later. Systemic antibiotics versus intranasal corticosteroids One study (43 participants, without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with intranasal corticosteroids. Patient-reported disease severity was assessed using a composite symptom score (0 to 40; 0 = no symptoms). It is very uncertain if there was a difference as patient-reported disease severity was similar between groups (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 to 1.47; low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics versus oral corticosteroids One study (28 participants, with polyps) compared a short course of tetracycline antibiotic (unclear duration, \u02dc20 days) with a 20-day course of oral corticosteroids. We were unable to extract data on any of the primary efficacy outcomes. It is uncertain if there was a difference ingastrointestinal disturbances (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.14) or skin irritation (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 19.62) as the results for these outcomes were similar between groups (very low quality evidence).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe found very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We did find moderate quality evidence of a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps receiving three months of a macrolide antibiotic. The size of improvement was moderate (0.5 points on a five-point scale) and only seen at the end of the three-month treatment; by three months later no difference was found.Despite a general understanding that antibiotics can be associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, the results in this review were very uncertain because the studies were small and few events were reported.No RCTs of topical antibiotics met the inclusion criteria.More research in this area, particularly evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.",

The participants were 133 adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis clinically diagnosed on maxillary pain and raised values of either C-reactive protein (CRP) or the erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) rate. Main outcome measures were pain score and illness score, and CRP and ESR values after initiation of treatment.\nRESULTS\n\n\nPenicillin V led to a better recovery than placebo.

The difference was statistically significant 3 days after the initiation of treatment with regard to pain reduction, whereas no significant difference was found with regard to the reduction in the sense of illness. At the end of the study, significantly more patients in the penicillin group were completely free of pain compared to the placebo group. This difference was only found in patients with an initial pain score of more than three. The cure rate was 71% in the penicillin group and 37% in the placebo group. Significantly more patients achieved normal CRP values when treated with penicillin (88%) as opposed to placebo (75%).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nPenicillin V is more effective than placebo in the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis in adults in general practice, but only in patients with pronounced pain.",

        "a9_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal theophylline saline irrigation on olfactory recovery in patients with post-viral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD).\nMETHODS\n\n\nBetween May 2019 and April 2020, we conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of adults with 6-36\u00a0months of PVOD. Patients were randomized to nasal theophylline saline irrigation or placebo saline irrigation twice a day for 6\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome was the Global Rating of Smell Change. Secondary outcomes were changes in the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (QOD-NS).\nRESULTS\n\n\nTwenty-two patients (n\u00a0=\u00a012, theophylline; n\u00a0=\u00a010, placebo) completed the study. Slightly more patients in the theophylline group (33%) reported improved smell compared to the placebo group (30%, difference 3.3%, 95% CI -35.6% to 42.3%). The median differences in pre- and post-treatment UPSIT and QOD-NS change between the two groups were 1 (95% CI -3 to 5) and -10 (95% CI -15 to -4), respectively in favor of theophylline. Three patients receiving theophylline and 2 receiving placebo had clinically meaningful improvements on the UPSIT (difference 5%, 95% CI -30% to 40%). There were no adverse events, and serum theophylline levels were undetectable in 10/10 patients.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWhile safe, there were no clinically meaningful differences in olfactory change between the two groups except for olfaction-related quality of life, which was better with theophylline. The imprecise estimates suggest future trials will need substantially larger sample sizes or treatment modifications, such as increasing the theophylline dose, to observe larger treatment effects.",

        "a10_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nOral and topical corticosteroids, and antibiotics form the mainstay medical treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Clinical outcomes vary depending on the chosen therapy, resident microbiome and disease phenotype. We conducted a double- blinded, placebo-controlled Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to investigate effects of medical therapy on clinical outcomes and associated microbiome shifts.\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n\nFifty eligible patients (CRS with and without polyps) were treated for 3 weeks after randomisation into 3 arms: na- mely oral prednisolone, topical budesonide irrigations and oral doxycycline; each with appropriate placebo. Clinical scoring and microbiome swabs were performed on enrolment, at treatment completion and 3-weeks post treatment completion. Microbiome analysis was performed using the llumina-MiSeq next generation sequencing platform and QIME-2 pipeline.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSignificant improvement in clinical scores was observed in prednisolone and budesonide arms at treatment completion but not with antibiotic. Sub-group analysis showed more pronounced effects in patients with polyposis. Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus species predominated, with variable bacterial relative abundance among different treatments at all time-points. The only significant microbiome finding was an increase in bacterial diversity in topical budesonide group immediately after treatment, which returned to baseline 3-weeks post treatment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nClinical improvement was significant with oral and topical steroid but not empirical antibiotic. Although there were some associated microbiome changes with the various treatments, we could not ascertain the consistency of these and whether they do have a clinical significance at all.",

To date, interventions to reduce cannabis consumption have been largely ineffective, and it has been suggested that longer treatment periods are required.\nMETHOD\n\n\nIn a pragmatic single-blind randomized controlled trial 110 participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: a brief motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy (MI-CBT) intervention (up to 12 sessions over 4.5 months) with standard care from an early intervention service; a long MI-CBT intervention (up to 24 sessions over 9 months) with standard care; or standard care alone.

Also the interventions did not result in improvements in the assessed clinical outcomes, including symptoms, functioning, hospital admissions or relapse.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIntegrated MI and CBT for people with cannabis use and recent-onset psychosis does not reduce cannabis use or improve clinical outcomes. These findings are consistent with those in the published literature, and additionally demonstrate that offering a more extended intervention does not confer any advantage.

We examined stressor reactivity to threat of unpredictable electric shock via startle potentiation among heavy marijuana users and a control group that reported minimal history of marijuana use. Heavy marijuana users were randomly assigned to 3 days of marijuana deprivation or no deprivation. This design allowed us to test contrasts for heavy (vs. minimal) use and deprivation (vs. no deprivation) on stressor reactivity. Heavy marijuana users (both deprived and nondeprived) displayed increased startle potentiation during threat of unpredictable electric shock relative to minimal use controls. In contrast, marijuana deprivation had no effect on startle potentiation. Startle potentiation was also increased among users who reported greater stress-coping motives for their marijuana use and users with cannabis use disorder diagnoses. To our knowledge, this is the 1st study to demonstrate increased reactivity to unpredictable stressors among heavy marijuana users. However, comparable increased unpredictable stressor reactivity among patients with alcohol and other substance use disorders has been previously documented. This relationship to heavy marijuana use is consistent with predictions from rodent addiction models regarding stress neuroadaptations following heavy, chronic drug use but could also represent an etiologically relevant premorbid risk characteristic. Finally, the clinical import of unpredictable stressor reactivity is reinforced by its relationships with stress-coping motives and cannabis use disorder status. (PsycINFO Database Record",

While they appear relatively socially stable, they typically demonstrated severe cannabis dependence and significantly elevated levels of psychological distress, with the most commonly cited reason for cannabis use being stress relief.

The current study is the first known experimental manipulation of state distress to test whether distress tolerance interacts with state distress to predict the urge to use cannabis. Current cannabis users (N = 126; 88.9% with cannabis use disorder; 54.0% non-Hispanic Caucasian) were randomly assigned to a distress task condition or neutral (reading) task condition. Participants in the 2 conditions did not differ on distress tolerance, negative affect (NA), or craving at baseline. The distress tolerance \u00d7 condition interaction significantly predicted task NA, such that low (but not high) distress tolerance was related to greater state NA throughout the task. The distress tolerance \u00d7 condition interaction significantly predicted cannabis craving during the task, such that the distress condition was related to greater cannabis craving at lower (but not higher) levels of distress tolerance. In the distress condition, those who endorsed coping motives during the task reported lower distress tolerance. Together these findings suggest that individuals with lower distress tolerance experienced greater NA during a laboratory-induced distress and reported greater cannabis craving when NA was greatest during the task. This experimental study adds to a growing, but limited, literature implicating lower levels of distress tolerance to the maintenance and relapse of cannabis use.

Each group received one of the pharmacological agents for 120 days. Four types of questionnaires were employed: The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression--21 items, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the Global Assessment of Functioning and a Visual Analogue Scale for perceived need of the drug. In addition, random urine tests were performed to detect tetrahydrocannabinol [THC).\nRESULTS\n\n\nNaltrexone proved to be the most efficacious of the four agents, with only four dropouts. Other agents proved less efficacious with six, seven and eights dropouts for bupropion, bromazepam and escitalopram, respectively. In addition, naltrexone was most efficacious in reducing anxiety and depression rates, and increasing functioning and perceived need for drug use.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nOut of four pharmacological agents, naltrexone proved to be most efficacious in treating marijuana addiction and related disorders.

Identifying factors that link PTSD symptom clusters and substance use disorder may illuminate mechanisms underlying the PTSD-substance use disorder relationship, better informing interventions that target this comorbidity. The current study of individuals enrolled in an outpatient aftercare chemical dependency program in King County, Washington, assessed whether overall PTSD symptoms and specific PTSD symptom clusters predicted craving depending on individuals identified primary drug of choice (DOC).  Methods:  Participants eligible for the parent study were at least 18\u2009years of age, fluent in English, medically cleared from substance withdrawal, and able to participate in treatment sessions and agreed to random assignment. Random assignment to either a mindfulness-based relapse prevention group, a standard relapse prevention group, or a treatment as usual group was conducted on a computer randomization program. A secondary analysis of baseline data was employed in the current study to determine which of the PTSD symptom clusters (avoidance, hyperarousal, and intrusion) predicted substance craving.  Results:  Covarying for severity of dependence, results suggest that overall PTSD scores predicted craving in participants who identified alcohol, stimulants, and opiates as their primary DOC. Further, avoidance-related PTSD symptoms alone predicted a significant proportion of the variability in craving in stimulant users, and hyperarousal symptoms alone predicted a significant proportion of the variability in craving in alcohol users. No specific PTSD cluster significantly predicted a proportion of the variability in craving in marijuana or opiates users.  Conclusions:  Findings suggest that craving may play a role in maintaining the relationship between specific PTSD symptom clusters and substance use disorder, and the nature of this relationship may differ by primary DOC. The clinical trial on which this secondary analysis of data was conducted is registered as NCT01159535 at www.clinicaltrials.gov.The original trial from which data for this study was drawn was supported by the National Institutes of Health [NIH/NIDA 5 R01 DA025764-02].",

There is a dramatic increase in the demand for treatment for cannabis dependence. Cannabis users frequently have co-morbid mood symptoms, especially depression and anxiety, and regular cannabis users may self-medicate for such symptoms.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nWe report a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment study, for the prevention of cannabis use in cannabis-dependent individuals.\nMETHOD\n\n\nRegular cannabis-dependent users (n\u2009=\u200952) were treated for 9 weeks with weekly cognitive-behavior and motivation-enhancement therapy sessions together with escitalopram 10\u2009mg/day. Urine samples were collected to monitor delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during treatment and questionnaires were administered to assess anxiety and depression.\nRESULTS\n\n\nWe observed a high rate of dropout (50%) during the 9-week treatment program. Fifty-two patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of these, ten (19%) remained abstinent after 9 weeks of treatment as indicated by negative urine samples for THC. Escitalopram provided no advantage over placebo in either abstinence rates from cannabis or anxiety and depression scores during the withdrawal and abstinent periods.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nEscitalopram treatment does not provide an additional benefit either for achieving abstinence, or for the treatment of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Due to limitations of our study, namely, a high dropout rate and effects of low abstinence rates on measures of anxiety, depression and withdrawal, it is premature to conclude that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not effective for treatment of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome.",

An alcohol by sugar interaction was seen at 0.5 after drinking. Sugar attenuated alcohol intoxication at this time without influencing blood alcohol levels. Contrary to previous reports, the combination of alcohol and sugar failed to produce significant hypoglycemia, or any of the adverse behavioral effects associated with hypoglycemia, at later times after drink ingestion. The second experiment involved a simpler design, carried out single-blind in which the subjects receiving no sugar did not get aspartame.

Alcohol-free beer has beneficial bioactive components but it has a relatively high glycemic-index so its consumption is restricted in diabetic subjects. We aimed to explore the effect of an alcohol-free beer with modified carbohydrate composition almost completely eliminating maltose and adding isomaltulose (16.5\u00a0g/day) and a resistant maltodextrin (5.28\u00a0g/day) in comparison to a regular alcohol-free beer on glycemic control of diabetic subjects with overweight or obesity.\nDESIGN\n\n\nWe randomized 41 subjects into two groups: a) consumption of 66\u00a0cL/day of; regular alcohol-free beer for the first 10 weeks and 66\u00a0cL/day of alcohol-free beer with modified carbohydrate composition for the next 10 weeks; b) the same described intervention in opposite order. There was a washout period for 6-8 weeks between the two interventions. Participants were counseled to adhere to a healthy diet for cardiovascular health and to increase physical activity. Clinical, biochemical, anthropometric, lifestyle and satiety assessments were performed at the beginning and at the end of each period.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSubjects showed significantly weight loss after the two ten weeks periods (-1.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.21% and\u00a0-1.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.70% after experimental and regular alcohol-free beers, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.881). Glucose and glycated hemoglobin did not significantly change after any period. Insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR significantly decreased (-11.1 [-21.3-4.64]% and\u00a0-1.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.8% respectively) after the intake of experimental alcohol-free beer but not after regular alcohol-free beer. Reductions remained statistically significant after adjusting for weight loss, energy intake, physical activity and intervention order. Subjects reported higher satiety scores after consuming experimental alcohol-free beer.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAn alcohol-free beer including the substitution of regular carbohydrates for low doses of isomaltulose and the addition of a resistant maltodextrin within meals led to an improvement in insulin resistance in subjects with T2DM and overweight or obesity.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nThe clinical trial has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03337828).",

However, they had their own limitations and concerns, particularly in terms of their taste and their long-term health consequences. This study examined the effect of a new mixture of sugars and sugar alcohol on the postprandial blood glucose levels and its possible gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions in human adults.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this double-blind three-way randomized clinical trial, adults (21 with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy) received 300ml of three beverages containing 50g glucose, sucrose, and lacritose (a mixture of lactose, fructose, sucrose, and erythritol) when they were in the fasted state in a random order. Postprandial serum glucose was checked every 30min up to 2h and the gastrointestinal reactions were collected.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe mean serum glucose was significantly lower in all time points after ingestion of the lacritose for participants with type 2 diabetes compared to glucose and sucrose (P<0.05). The blood glucose levels were significantly lower in the 30th and 60th min for healthy subjects (P<0.05). Adverse GI reactions were not significant between the test beverages.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe ingestion of a 50g dose of lacritose containing lactose, fructose, sucrose, and erythritol, led to an improved blood glucose levels without any significant adverse effect compared to the same amount of glucose and sucrose. Studying the long-term effects of lacritose on appetite, metabolic markers and adverse reactions is recommended.

When 14 men (9 normal weight and 5 obese) aged between 20 and 50 years consumed a 50 g glucose load together with 50 g ethanol over an hour, their early plasma insulin response was significantly higher and their later fall in plasma glucose significantly lower than after drinking the same amount of a starch solution (maize meal) and alcohol.

The World Health Organization recommends restricting consumption of sugars to no more than 10% of daily caloric intake, with a proposal to lower this level to 5% or less for optimal health. Unfortunately substituting sugar with the currently available artificial sweeteners does not appear to have favorable clinical effects. Given the health-related concerns with the currently available sweeteners such as increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes there is renewed interest in identifying a safe and palatable sweetener. The sweet extracts of natural plants such as stevia and monk fruit as well as naturally occurring rare sugars have become attractive alternatives. Although most of the sweeteners are sugars, there are some proteins such as braziien and miraculin that have intense sweetness and are being developed as sweeteners. Several companies are pursuing the development of \"bitterness-blockers\" to remove flavor defects. Other novel approaches include coating mineral carriers with sugar or hollowing out the sugar crystals. Naturally occurring rare sugars such as D-allulose (D-psicose), D-tagatose, D-sorbose and D-allose are attractive sweeteners. They do have the bulk and the mouth fill of table sugar with reduced caloric content (0.2\u00a0kcal/g for D-allulose).

Drinks with low sugar claims were also perceived as being lower in alcohol (P\u2009<\u20090.001) despite being of equivalent alcohol content. There were no significant differences in anticipated social approval associated with consumption or in hypothetical intended consumption of the drinks, but participants who viewed drinks with low sugar claims were less likely to indicate they would compensate for consumption of the drink by modifying food intake or physical activity (P\u2009=\u20090.01).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nLow sugar and related claims on alcoholic drinks can generate a health halo: consumers generalise from a specific favourable attribute (low sugar) to misperceive other favourable health- and nutrition-related attributes, including lower alcohol content.

        "a7_doc": "Sugar alcohols are used in food products, yet their metabolic effects in humans are poorly known. We examined plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses and changes in carbohydrate and lipid oxidation after the ingestion of 25 g lactitol, xylitol, or glucose. Eight healthy, nonobese men were studied after an overnight fast. After the ingestion of lactitol or xylitol, the rise in plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations was less than after the ingestion of glucose (P < 0.02), with no difference between the two polyols. With the glycemic index of glucose as 100, the indexes of xylitol and lactitol were 7 and -1, respectively. A reactive hypoglycemia was observed 3 h after glucose ingestion, but not after the ingestion of sugar alcohols. There were no significant changes in the carbohydrate or lipid oxidation as determined by indirect calorimetry after the ingestion of sugar alcohols. After glucose ingestion, the rise in carbohydrate oxidation was nearly significant (P = 0.07). In conclusion, lactitol and xylitol cause smaller changes than does glucose in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations and thermogenic response. A small hormonal response and the lack of a thermogenic effect may be beneficial when these sugar alcohols are used in food products. The small glucose and insulin responses also suggest that lactitol and xylitol are suitable components of the diet for diabetic patients.",

The fraction of sugar alcohols absorbed in the small intestine was evaluated by comparing the amounts of hydrogen excreted in breath for 8 h after the ingestion of lactulose and of sugar alcohols. Energy value of sugar alcohols was determined knowing the amounts absorbed in the small intestine and digested in the colon. Tolerance to the sugar alcohols was good in all volunteers, and not different between sugar alcohols. The mean percentage of malabsorption in the small intestine was significantly higher for lactitol (84 +/- 14 percent, m +/- SEM) than for maltitol and isomalt (44 +/- 7 and 40 +/- 7 percent), its energy value (2.3 +/- 0.3 kcal/g) was significantly lower than the energy value of maltitol (3.1 +/- 0.1 kcal/g, P less than 0.05); whereas those of sorbitol and isomalt were close (2.7 +/- 0.2 and 2.8 +/- 0.1 kcal/g, respectively). In spite of these differences, our results suggest that in our experimental conditions, bacterial digestion of the sugar alcohols reaching the colon was complete, and did not affect their clinical tolerance.",

However, evidence for first-choice antidepressants in patients with anxious depression is limited. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram, desvenlafaxine, and vortioxetine in the acute treatment of anxious depression.\nMethods\n\n\nPatients (n = 124) with major depressive disorder and high levels of anxiety were randomly assigned to an escitalopram treatment group (n = 42), desvenlafaxine treatment group (n = 40), or vortioxetine treatment group (n = 42) in a 6-week randomized rater-blinded head-to-head comparative trial. Changes in overall depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), respectively.\nResults\n\n\nPatients demonstrated similar baseline-to-endpoint improvement in scores and similar response and remission rates for HAMD and HAMA. Analysis of the individual HAMD items revealed that desvenlafaxine significantly reduced anxiety somatic scores ( p  = 0.013) and hypochondriasis scores ( p  = 0.014) compared to escitalopram. With respect to the individual HAMA items, desvenlafaxine treatment showed significantly lower scores for respiratory symptoms ( p  = 0.013) than escitalopram treatment and cardiovascular symptoms ( p  = 0.005) than vortioxetine treatment.

Sexual functioning was assessed by the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire-14 (CSFQ-14), efficacy by the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores (MADRS) and Clinicians Global Impression of Severity/Improvement (CGI-S/CGI-I), and tolerability by adverse events. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed by pre-switch SSRI therapy where possible, and by participant characteristics.\nRESULTS\n\n\nGreater improvements in TESD were seen in the vortioxetine compared with escitalopram groups based on: participant demographics (\u226445 years, women; P = 0.045), prior SSRI treatment (P = 0.044), number of prior major depressive episodes (MDEs) (1-3; P = 0.001), and duration of prior SSRI therapy (>1 year; P = 0.001). Prior SSRI treatment did not appear to influence the incidence or severity of TEAEs, except for nausea. Regardless of prior SSRI, both treatments maintained antidepressant efficacy after 8 weeks.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nResults suggest that vortioxetine is a safe and effective switch therapy for treating SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction in adults with well-treated MDD. Also, improvement in sexual dysfunction with vortioxetine or escitalopram may be influenced by prior SSRI usage, sex, age, and history of MDEs.",

There is no trial comparing different treatment methods in patients with anxiety/somatic subtype MDD.\nAIM\n\n\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of various treatments in patients with anxiety/somatic subtype MDD.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a preliminary multicenter randomized controlled trial at eight participating hospitals in China (09/2016-06/2019) (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT03219008). The patients were randomized to mirtazapine/SNRIs, mirtazapine/SNRIs+cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mirtazapine+SNRIs, or mirtazapine+SNRIs+physical therapies (modified electroconvulsive treatment or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation). The primary endpoint was the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17). The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) and Quality of Life (QOL)-6 were the secondary endpoints. The adverse events (AEs) were monitored. The patients were assessed at baseline (0 weeks), and at the end of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 12th week during treatment.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFinally, 107 patients were included: mirtazapine/SNRIs (n=36), mirtazapine/SNRIs+CBT (n=28), mirtazapine+SNRIs (n=29), and mirtazapine+SNRIs+physical therapies (n=14). The 17-HDRS and QIDS-SR scores decreased in all four groups, and the QOL-6 scores increased. There were no differences in the 17-HDRS (P=0.099), QIDS-SR (P=0.407), and QOL-6 (P=0.485) scores among the four groups. There were no differences in the occurrence of AEs among the four groups (P=0.942).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis preliminary trial suggests that all four interventions (mirtazapine/SNRIs, mirtazapine/SNRIs+CBT, mirtazapine+SNRIs, or mirtazapine+SNRIs+physical therapies) achieved similar response and remission rates in patients with anxiety/somatic subtype MDD. The safety profile was manageable.",

        "a8_doc": "From theoretical and clinical perspectives, it is important to know if selected serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), often administered concurrently with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), modify seizure duration. In a study with a double-blind, cross-over design, the authors evaluated the effect of citalopram, the most selective SSRI available, on the length of electrically induced seizures and on hormone secretion during ECT. Ten depressed women were given either 20 mg citalopram or placebo orally 2 hours before the third and fourth ECT sessions. Seizure duration was assessed by the cuff technique and from electroencephalographic recordings, whereas blood for prolactin, thyrotropin, and cortisol assessment was sampled before ECT and 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes after ECT. No adverse effects after the administration of citalopram were recorded. The length of seizures was not statistically different in the citalopram (29.3+/-8.4 seconds) and placebo sessions (28.2+/-9.4 seconds). Neither pre-ECT plasma hormone levels measured 2 hours after citalopram or placebo administration nor the patterns of ECT-induced hormone secretions differed between the two drug and placebo conditions. The lack of effect of citalopram on hormones in this study may be a result of possible deficiencies of the monoaminergic (i.e., serotoninergic) systems in depression. Although safety and efficacy issues were not fully addressed by coadministering citalopram for the long term and throughout the course of ECT, these findings support the view that challenges the typical clinical practice of discontinuing SSRIs before ECT.",

The study aimed to examine differential therapeutic and side effect responses when antidepressants are discontinued or not during ECT.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis study compared the effectiveness and side effect profile of unilateral ECT with antidepressant drugs (Group-1) or unilateral ECT with drug placebo (Group-2) in 30 major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) patients on antidepressants using a prospective randomised trial. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), UKU scale, Columbia ECT side effect check list were used. The assessments were carried out before starting ECTs and at fixed intervals thereafter for four weeks. In addition, at six weeks a follow-up assessment was carried out using HRSD. ECTs were stopped after four weeks or earlier if patient obtained HRSD scores <8 and remained so for one week.\nRESULTS\n\n\nContinuation of antidepressant drugs with ECT conferred no therapeutic advantage. Barring tricyclic antidepressant induced anticholinergic side effects, no differential side effect profile was noted. At follow-up none relapsed in Group-2 and the mean HRSD scores between the groups did not differ.\nLIMITATION\n\n\nThe antidepressant treatment prior to ECT was uncontrolled. In addition, the design was not strictly double-blind.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe study failed to support an advantage with antidepressant continuation during an ECT course in major depressive disorder.",

In this secondary analysis, data from PRISE were used to determine the incidence of DAEs during first-step treatment with citalopram and second-step treatment with sustained-release bupropion, sertraline, or extended-release venlafaxine. Regression models were used to compare the risk of adverse events during second-step treatment between those who reported similar adverse events during first-step treatment and those who did not, while controlling for potential confounders. Of the 727 patients analyzed, DAEs were reported by 514 patients (70.7%) during first-step treatment and 626 (86.1%) during second-step treatment; no significant differences were observed among the three second-step treatment groups. Overall, patients reporting DAEs during first-step treatment were more likely to report DAEs during second-step treatment (risk ratio [RR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.20). After controlling for confounders, patients were significantly more likely to report DAEs specific to a body function or organ system, such as those involving the genitourinary system (RR 3.39, 95% CI 2.41-4.78) or sexual functioning (RR 2.75, 95% CI 2.29-3.29), if the patients had reported similar events during initial treatment.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nPatients who experienced DAEs with initial antidepressant treatment were likely to report similar adverse events after switching to an alternative antidepressant, even when subsequent treatment is from a different class of antidepressants.",

Sooo in short, my body really doesn't like SSRIs (bit inconvenient when you're chronically depressed ngl). \n\nI saw a new psychiatrist a few weeks ago who mentioned that there are antidepressants that don't lower the seizure threshold. Thing is, I would love to take something, ANYTHING that could help but I am also terrified of the whole \"what if I have another one?\". My seizures are controlled with meds now so maybe that would also reduce the risk of it happening again...? idk.\n\nAnyone else had issues with antidepressants? if so, did you find something else that helped?\n\nI'm trying to way up my options here, so any advice would be greatly appreciated xx",

This study was a randomized clinical trial on 64 IBS patients. The patients were selected according to Rome III criteria and were assigned into two groups. Bowel symptom severity and frequency scale and QOL-IBS were used to investigate the patients' symptoms. The first group underwent CBT with medication therapy, and the second group received only medication. Data were analyzed using analysis of multiple covariance. The two groups showed a significant difference in the QOL-IBS in posttreatment and follow-up stages ( P  < 0.05). There were significant differences in the severity and frequency of IBS symptoms between the two groups after the intervention ( P  < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed at follow-up stage between the two groups ( P  > 0.05). CBT accompanied by drug therapy can be useful for IBS patients with diarrhea predominance.

We assessed left colonic compliance, motility index (MI), tone, and sensation during fasting and after a meal. We analyzed the single nucleotide polymorphisms CNR1 rs806378, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) rs324420, and MGLL rs4881.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn all patients, dronabinol decreased fasting proximal left colonic MI compared with placebo (overall P = .05; for 5 mg dronabinol, P = .046), decreased fasting distal left colonic MI (overall P = .08; for 5 mg, P = .13), and increased colonic compliance (P = .058).

        "a6_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nA single previous paper on this topic found a direct pathway between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) global symptom score. This is controversial since under the biopsychosocial model, the expectation is that CBT's effect would be mediated by mood. Using more sensitive bowel symptom scales and measurements at additional time points, we aimed to compare the relative strengths of direct pathways between CBT and change in IBS symptoms and indirect pathways that operate via mood state using structural equation modeling.\nMETHODS\n\n\nOur data set included 105 people with Rome I IBS randomized to individual CBT (n=34), relaxation therapy (n=36), and usual medical care (n=35). The primary outcome was defined as adequate relief of IBS symptoms in terms of the distress, frequency, and impairment according to the Bowel Symptom Severity Scale. Outcomes in functional status (according to the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey) and psychological status (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were secondary outcomes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOur data suggest indirect pathways that operate via mood, most clearly anxiety but to a lesser extent depression. Statistically significant pathways were identified that lead from CBT to change in mood state thence to change in bowel symptoms, followed by further changes in mood then changes in bowel symptoms. Our data provide no evidence of direct effect of CBT on bowel symptoms.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe present study suggests that CBT may operate via changes in mood state while not ruling out the possibility of direct effects. Our findings do not directly support, but are consistent with, a biopsychosocial model.",

        "p8": "There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between CBD and placebo at a group level.",
        "a8_doc": "Background:  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders. Its pathophysiology is diverse and variable, involving disturbed gut-brain interactions, altered motility and secretion, visceral hypersensitivity, increased intestinal permeability, immune activation, and changes in gut microbiota. Complaints experienced by patients suffering from IBS and its co-morbidities strongly impair quality of life (QoL), and available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Anecdotal reports and preclinical data suggest that the endocannabinoid system and functionally related mechanisms could offer treatment targets. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a candidate agent of interest with a broad molecular target profile and the absence of psychoactive properties.  Materials and Methods:  In 32 female IBS patients, we explored the effect of a chewing gum formulation containing 50\u2009mg CBD on abdominal pain and perceived well-being in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Chewing gums were used on-demand guided by pain symptoms with a maximum of six per day. Pain intensity was assessed by a visual analogue scale (scale 0.0-10.0), and QoL was evaluated with the IBS-36 questionnaire.  Results:  There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores between CBD and placebo at a group level. Subgroup and individual analyses showed a highly variable picture. No indications were found for symptom-driven intake, which also remained lower than expected overall.  Conclusions:  With the current design, based on the assumption that IBS patients would adjust their intake to their perceived symptom relief, no differences at the group level were found between CBD and placebo gum in pain scores and the number of gums used. The low use of the gums also indicates that the benefits experienced by these patients generally did not outweigh practical disadvantages such as prolonged chewing throughout the day. The very high intra- and inter-individual variation in IBS symptoms warrant future trials that are more personalized, for example by applying an N-of-1 (rotating) design with individualized dose titration.",

Thirteen participants completed treatment and follow-up. All subjects assigned to the Wait List were subsequently treated. Patients in the treatment condition were taught the meditation technique and asked to practice it twice a day for 15 minutes. Composite Primary IBS Symptom Reduction (CPSR) scores were calculated for each patient from end of baseline to two weeks post-treatment (or to post wait list). One tailed independent sample t-tests revealed that Meditation was superior to the control (P=0.04). Significant within-subject improvements were noted for flatulence (P=0.03) and belching (P=0.02) by post-treatment. By three month follow-up, significant improvements in flatulence (P<0.01), belching (P=0.02), bloating (P=0.05), and diarrhea (P=0.03) were shown by symptom diary.

Patients diagnosed with Crohn disease, aged 18 years or older, who reported being active smokers with Internet access at home and an e-mail address were eligible. A total of 144 patients (72 per group) were included (50% women, median age 40 years).

The hypothyroidism that occurs in the first year following radioactive iodine therapy is probably related to the destructive effects of the radiation and underlying ongoing autoimmunity.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo study the outcomes at the end of six months after fixed dose I, (131)therapy for Graves' disease followed by an iodine restricted diet for a period of six months.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nConsecutive adult patients with Graves' disease planned for I(131) therapy were randomized either to receive instructions regarding dietary iodine restriction or no advice prior to fixed dose (5mCi) I(131) administration. Thyroid functions and urinary iodine indices were evaluated at 3(rd) and 6(th) month subsequently.\nRESULTS\n\n\nForty seven patients (13M and 34F) were assessed, 2 were excluded, 45 were randomized (Cases 24 and Controls 21) and 39 patients completed the study.

The focus was on possible progressive changes and any relationships between the incidence of\nprimary hypothyroidism, the time required to become hypothyroid, and factors such as chemotherapy, hormonotherapy\nand immunotherapy. Materials and Methods: Seventy females undergoing 3D conformal and IMRT radiation therapy\nfor breast cancers were enrolled in a non-randomized prospective study. The patients was divided into two groups:\nthose after mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS) were irradiated to a scar of the chest wall/breast and the\nipsilateral supraclavicular and the axillary areas (supraclavicular radiotherapy group - SC-RT group \u2013 32 patients) and\nthe control group receiving adjuvant chest wall/breast RT only (BCT group - 38 patients).The total doses were 50.0\nto 70 Gy in 5 to 7 weeks. The median follow-up term was 24 months (range, 1\u201340 months). Thyroid function was\nevaluated by measuring thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels.\nThe minimum, maximum and mean thyroid gland doses for 20 Gy (V20) were calculated for all patients. Results:\nStatistically significant results were obtained for the SC-RT group. Two yearsa fter the end of RT the chance of an event\nwas increased in 6% of the population (p=0.009) in the SC-RT group. In the BCT group no significance was noted.

The study was designed as a single-blinded randomised prospective outcome trial. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled, consisting of 50 females and 8 males aged from 17 to 75 years. Each patient was investigated by clinical assessment, biochemical and immunological assessment, thyroid ultrasound, technetium-99m thyroid scintigraphy and 24-h thyroid 131I uptake. Patients were then randomised into two treatment groups, one receiving 60 Gy and the other receiving 90 Gy thyroid tissue absorbed dose of radioiodine. The end-point markers were clinical and biochemical response to treatment. The median follow-up period was 37.5 months (range, 24-48 months). Among the 57 patients who completed final follow-up, a euthyroid state was achieved in 26 patients (46%), 27 patients (47%) were rendered hypothyroid and four patients (7%) remained hyperthyroid. Thirty-four patients (60%) remained hyperthyroid at 6 months after the initial radioiodine dose (median dose 126 MBq), and a total of 21 patients required additional radioiodine therapy (median total dose 640 MBq; range 370-1,485 MBq). At 6-month follow-up, of the 29 patients who received a thyroid tissue dose of 90 Gy, 17 (59%) remained hyperthyroid. By comparison, of the 28 patients who received a thyroid tissue dose of 60 Gy, 17 (61%) remained hyperthyroid. No significant difference in treatment response was found (P=0.881). At 6 months, five patients in the 90-Gy group were hypothyroid, compared to two patients in the 60-Gy group (P=0.246). Overall at 6 months, non-responders to low-dose therapy had a significantly larger thyroid gland mass (respective means: 35.9 ml vs 21.9 ml) and significantly higher levels of serum thyroglobulin (respective means: 597.6 microg/l vs 96.9 microg/l). Where low-dose radioiodine treatment of Graves' disease is considered, a dose of 60 Gy will yield a 39% response rate at 6 months while minimising early hypothyroidism. No significant advantage in response rate is gained by using a dose of 90 Gy. For more rapid therapeutic effect at the expense of an increased rate of hypothyroidism, doses in excess of 120 Gy may be required. Ultrasound determination of thyroid mass and measurement of serum thyroglobulin levels may be predictive of those patients who will be less responsive to low-dose therapy.",

Activities administered ranged from 1000 to 4500 MBq. I-131 kinetics was followed daily during first 4 days after activity administration on the basis of mathematical analysis of scintigraphy. T(ef) was calculated under the assumption of exponential excretion of 131-I from remnants. It was shown that in Group 1 T(eff) = 3.87 +/- 2.5 days, in Group 2 T(eff) amounted to 2.9 +/- 2.2 days. Thus, external irradiation resulted in slowing down of 131-I excretion in thyroid remnants. The probability of the full remnants ablation after the first course of 131-I treatment (p) has been calculated. It was shown that p is higher in the Group 2 in every activity interval. Teff in sequential courses of 131-I treatment has been measured at the same patients. Thus, external irradiation influences in different way at the previously irradiated and not irradiated cells.",

After randomization, 8 patients were excluded from the study (5 from pretreatment group and 3 from nonpretreatment group). Radioactive iodine (baseline dose 15 mCi, adjusted for goiter size and/or 131I uptake) was administered after pretreatment with methimazole (30 mg initial dose for at least 2 months and stopped 6 days before treatment) and beta-blocker or pretreatment with beta-blocker alone (atenolol 50-100 mg/d). All but one patient in each group became hypothyroid. A similar length of time was required by both groups to achieve hypothyroidism (112 days, [95% confidence interval [CI] = 28 to 196 days) in the pretreated group and 106 days, [95% CI = 45 to 167 days] in nonpretreated patients). Free thyroxine (T4) normalized 44 +/- 39 days after therapy in the nonpretreated group and 35 +/- 30 days in the pretreated group (p = 0.57) and decreased to subnormal levels 80 +/- 70 days in nonpretreated and 65 +/- 32 days in pretreated patients (p = 0.46).

The administration of the smallest possible amount of radioiodine would improve care.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn our randomized, phase 3 trial, we compared two thyrotropin-stimulation methods (thyroid hormone withdrawal and use of recombinant human thyrotropin) and two radioiodine ((131)I) doses (i.e., administered activities) (1.1 GBq and 3.7 GBq) in a 2-by-2 design. Inclusion criteria were an age of 18 years or older; total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma; tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, ascertained on pathological examination (p) of a surgical specimen, of pT1 (with tumor diameter \u22641 cm) and N1 or Nx, pT1 (with tumor diameter >1 to 2 cm) and any N stage, or pT2N0; absence of distant metastasis; and no iodine contamination. Thyroid ablation was assessed 8 months after radioiodine administration by neck ultrasonography and measurement of recombinant human thyrotropin-stimulated thyroglobulin. Comparisons were based on an equivalence framework.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were 752 patients enrolled between 2007 and 2010; 92% had papillary cancer. There were no unexpected serious adverse events. In the 684 patients with data that could be evaluated, ultrasonography of the neck was normal in 652 (95%), and the stimulated thyroglobulin level was 1.0 ng per milliliter or less in 621 of the 652 patients (95%) without detectable thyroglobulin antibodies. Thyroid ablation was complete in 631 of the 684 patients (92%). The ablation rate was equivalent between the (131)I doses and between the thyrotropin-stimulation methods.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe use of recombinant human thyrotropin and low-dose (1.1 GBq) postoperative radioiodine ablation may be sufficient for the management of low-risk thyroid cancer.

Selecting an optimal dose of radioiodine for successful ablation is a continuous challenge in these patients.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe compared the treatment response of 341 patients with thyroidectomy randomly allocated to the high-dose group, 3700 MBq (170 patients), versus the low-dose group, 1110 MBq (171 patients), for radioiodine ablation therapy in a double-blind randomized clinical trial. The response to treatment was defined as successful or unsuccessful according to post-therapy ultrasonography of the neck, serum thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg, and functioning residual tissue after 6-month and 12-month intervals. The major criteria of successful ablation were Tg<2 ng/ml, anti-Tg<100 IU/ml, and absent remnant in the off-levothyroxine state. Additional radioiodine doses were administered in cases showing no significant response to the first therapy. Finally, the initial outcome, the total hospitalization time, and the cumulative I-131 doses during the 12-month course of the study were compared between the subgroups.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe rate of initial successful ablation was 51.6% in all patients, 39.2% in the low-dose group, and 64.1% in the high-dose group. The corresponding success rates at the end of the 12-month follow-up without additional treatment were 55.1, 41.5, and 68.8%, respectively. The relative risk (RR) of unsuccessful ablation for the low-dose versus the high-dose group was 1.695 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.34-2.14]. In the low-dose group, more patients needed a second dose of I-131, resulting in a higher cumulative activity (median, 4810 vs. 3700 MBq, P<0.0001) and more inpatient time (median 4 vs. 3 days) in comparison with the high-dose group. The covariate factors predicting the treatment response, in order of significance, were radioiodine dose, baseline Tg, baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, efficiency of TSH suppressive therapy, and sex.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe higher dose of I-131 (3700 MBq) resulted in successful ablation more often than the low dose (1110 MBq).",

        "a9_doc": "Radioiodine (131I) is the preferred definitive treatment for Graves' hyperthyroidism. Pretreatment with antithyroid drugs is often used to avoid thyroid hormone discharge after 131I ablation. However, this may represent an unnecessary increase in risk and costs. Fifty-one patients with Graves' disease were randomly assigned to receive 131I alone (28 patients) or 131I plus pretreatment with methimazole (30 mg/day; 23 patients). Methimazole was interrupted 4 days before 131I therapy. Serum T4, free T4 (FT4), and T3 were measured on days -4 and -1, on the day of treatment, and on days 2, 5, 7, 14, 20, and 30. In patients receiving 131I alone, mean serum T4 levels did not change after therapy. Mean serum FT4 and T3 levels decreased significantly 5 days after 131I administration (15% and 18%, respectively). Serum T3 reached its lowest level on day 30 (38%). With pretreatment, mean serum T4, FT4, and T3 levels increased (38%, 39%, and 70%, respectively) after methimazole discontinuation and before 131I administration. After 131I, serum T4 levels peaked on day 7 (23% vs. treatment day; 70% vs. baseline); FT4 levels peaked on day 14 (53% vs. treatment day; 107% vs. baseline). The serum T3 concentration increased 9% on day 2 (85% vs. baseline) and decreased from day 14 (15%) to day 30 (21%). We conclude that interruption of antithyroid drugs causes a short term increase in serum thyroid hormone levels in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism receiving 131I. Thyroid hormone levels stabilize or decrease during the first 30 days after 131I therapy.",

        "a10_doc": "We investigated the effect of therapeutic doses of radioiodine (RAI) on peripheral serum messenger thyroglobulin RNA (Tg mRNA) and serum thyroglobulin (sTg) in patients with multinodular goiter (MNG) preceded or not by treatment with recombinant human TSH (rhTSH). Fourteen patients with large MNG (91-542 ml) received RAI (550-2960 MBq). Half of the patients received 0.45 mg of rhTSH prior to the treatment (RAI+rhTSH group) and half did not (RAI group). Patients' blood samples were collected before and 24, 48, and 72 h; 7 and 30 days; and 6, 9, and 12 months after RAI treatment. Serum Tg was measured by immunoradiometric assay, serum anti-Tg by radioimmunoassay, and quantification of circulating Tg mRNA was performed by real-time PCR. The shrinkage of MNG volume was documented by serial computed tomography (CT) scans before, 6 and 12 months after RAI. Peak Tg mRNA and sTg were reached earlier in the RAI+rhTSH group (24 h and 48 h) than in the RAI group (7 days). Both declined after the peak and the lowest levels were observed at 12 months. The mean reduction of the thyroid volume was 19.8% (RAI group) and 30.3% (RAI+rhTSH group) at 6 months (ns) and 32.8% RAI and 52.5% (RAI+rhTSH group) at 12 months (p<0.05). After RAI treatment there was a significant and positive correlation between goiter volume and sTg only in the RAI group (r=0.7; p=0.032). Serum anti-Tg had a transitory and relatively small elevation in 3 and 2 patients, respectively, in the RAI and RAI+rhTSH groups. We concluded that after RAI ablation of MNG there is a rapid release of Tg into the serum possibly from the colloid, which is followed by an elevation of serum Tg mRNA that may be due to an increased release of follicular cells into the blood stream. Both phenomena are enhanced by the use of rhTSH before RAI treatment as a consequence of a more effective and prolonged radiation exposure of the thyroid follicles.",

One month after radiation, I stand at 100. My doctor said thats a huge drop and it looks promising, but if my number doesnt drop significantly in the next month, I will be receiving external radiation as the next step.\n\nI know iodine radiation stays in you for up to three months, so is there a high chance that my thyroglobulin will drop from 100? How long after iodine radiation were you declared cancer free? \n\nThank you in advance!",

Twenty-eight people with FEP and 21 nonclinical controls were assessed for CT and psychotic and posttraumatic stress symptoms and completed an emotional Stroop test using CSA-related and other words. Those with FEP and CSA had more severe hallucinations and delusions than those with FEP and without CSA.

The stimuli consisted of pairs of words that were either related or unrelated to a given semantic category. The process dissociation procedure was used to calculate the estimates of familiarity and recollection processes. Both groups showed enhanced memory performances for semantically related words. However, in healthy controls, semantic relatedness led to enhanced recollection, while in schizophrenia patients, it induced enhanced familiarity.

        "a5_doc": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\n\n\nPeople with a diagnosis of psychosis often experience low motivation and reduced activity levels. Autobiographical memory deficits have been identified in people with psychosis and this may limit the role of memory retrieval in supporting motivation. This pilot study adapted a recently developed protocol, Memflex, which aims to enhance autobiographical memory and has shown promise in depression. Our brief intervention targets experiential negative symptoms of psychosis using supported autobiographical memory retrieval.\nMETHOD\n\n\nA sample of 31 participants with psychosis were recruited from inpatient and community settings and randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either a basic recall control or an enhanced recall intervention group. Participants were asked to generate positive autobiographical memories linked to activities they wish to repeat in the future. The enhanced recall condition received additional prompts from the Memflex protocol, and the basic recall condition received no additional support.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe intervention delivered was acceptable (rated >80%) and feasible (94% adherence) to those who took part. Participants were able to generate positive autobiographical memories linked to their goals and experienced appropriate emotions linked to these. The controlled preliminary effect sizes (0.2-0.34) showed encouraging signals for self-efficacy, motivation and a reduction in negative mood.\nLIMITATIONS\n\n\nAs this was a pilot study with a small sample size between-group tests of statistical significance were not conducted, and therefore findings should be interpreted with caution.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThese findings suggest that guided autobiographical memory retrieval may be an effective way tool for targeting motivation in people with psychosis.",

A randomized, blinded trial of two mnemonic strategies for verbal episodic memory deficits for people with schizophrenia was conducted.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSixty-one people with schizophrenia were assigned to one of three experimental conditions: training in a mnemonic strategy that included both visualization and narrative structure (Story Method), a condition in which participants were trained to visualize words interacting with one another (Imagery), or a non-trained control condition in which participants received equivalent exposure to training word lists and other verbal memory assessments administered in the other two conditions, but without provision of any compensatory mnemonic strategy. Participants were assessed on improvements in recall of the word list used as part of training, as well as two, standardized verbal memory assessments which included stimuli not used as part of strategy training.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe Story Method produced improvements on a trained word list that generalized to a non-trained, prose memory task at a 1-week follow-up. In contrast, provision of a mnemonic strategy of simple visualization of words produced little improvement on word recall of trained words or on measures of generalization relative to the performance of participants in the control condition.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThese findings support the inclusion of enriched mnemonic strategies consisting of both visualization and narrative structure in sustained and comprehensive programs of CR for enhancement of verbal episodic memory in schizophrenia.

        "a7_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nMemory deficits are commonly experienced by patients with schizophrenia, often persist even after effective psychotropic treatment of psychotic symptoms and have been demonstrated to interfere with many aspects of successful psychiatric rehabilitation. Because of significant impact on functional outcome, effective remediation of cognitive deficits has been increasingly cited as an essential component of comprehensive treatment. Efforts to remediate memory deficits have met with circumscribed success, leaving uncertain whether schizophrenia patients can be taught, without experimental induction, independently to employ semantic encoding or a range of other mnemonic techniques.\nMETHOD\n\n\nWe examined the feasibility of using memory and problem solving teaching techniques developed within educational psychology--techniques which promote intrinsic motivation and task engagement through contextualization and personalization of learning activities--to remediate memory deficits in a group of in-patients with chronic schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAlthough our memory remediation group significantly improved on the memory remediation task, they did not make greater gains on measures of immediate paragraph recall or list learning than the control groups.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nTargeted remediation of memory appears to yield task specific improvement but the gains do not generalize to other memory tasks. Subjects receiving memory remediation failed to independently activate mnemonic encoding strategies learned and used successfully within training tasks to other general measures of verbal learning and memory.",

Before treatment, patients showed significantly reduced P600 amplitudes on the right parietal region compared with controls, and when in remission also showed significantly reduced P600 amplitudes located on the right parietal and temporofrontal areas, compared both to themselves before treatment and to normal controls. The patient's memory performance before and after treatment remained significantly lower than that of healthy controls. These findings may indicate that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia are associated with impaired synchronization of the processes related to target detection, as reflected by the P600.

Investigating changes in cognitive function preceding relapse may provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of relapse in psychosis. We hypothesized that relapse in fully remitted first-episode psychosis patients was preceded by working memory deterioration.\nMETHOD\n\n\nVisual memory and verbal working memory were monitored prospectively in a 1-year randomized controlled trial of remitted first-episode psychosis patients assigned to medication continuation (quetiapine 400 mg/day) or discontinuation (placebo). Relapse (recurrence of positive symptoms of psychosis), visual (Visual Patterns Test) and verbal (Letter-Number span test) working memory and stressful life events were assessed monthly.\nRESULTS\n\n\nRemitted first-episode patients (n = 102) participated in the study. Relapsers (n = 53) and non-relapsers (n = 49) had similar baseline demographic and clinical profiles. Logistic regression analyses indicated relapse was associated with visual working memory deterioration 2 months before relapse [odds ratio (OR) 3.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-7.92, P = 0.02], more stressful life events 1 month before relapse (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.20-3.72, P = 0.01) and medication discontinuation (OR 5.52, 95% CI 2.08-14.62, P = 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nVisual working memory deterioration beginning 2 months before relapse in remitted first-episode psychosis patients (not baseline predictor) may reflect early brain dysfunction that heralds a psychotic relapse. The deterioration was found to be unrelated to a worsening of psychotic symptoms preceding relapse. Testable predictors offer insight into the brain processes underlying relapse in psychosis.",

We aimed to investigate the relationship between Vitamin D and thyroid autoimmunity.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nEighty-two patients, diagnosed with AITD by the endocrinology outpatient clinic, were included in this prospective study. All of the patients had both AITD and Vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum values <20 ng/mL. They were randomly assigned into two groups. The first group included 46 patients and the second one included 36 patients. The first group was treated with Vitamin D for 1 month at 1000 IU/day. The second group served as the control group and was not treated with Vitamin D replacement. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4 (fT4), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab), thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), and Vitamin D levels were measured at the initiation of the study and again at 1 month in all patients.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTwo groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and type of thyroid disease. Whereas TPO-Ab (before; 278.3 \u00b1 218.4 IU/ml and after; 267.9 \u00b1 200.7 IU/ml) and TgAb (before; 331.9 \u00b1 268.1 IU/ml and after; 275.4 \u00b1 187.3 IU/ml) levels were significantly decreased by the Vitamin D replacement therapy in group 1 ( P  = 0.02,  P  = 0.03, respectively), the evaluated parameters in the control group did not significantly change ( P  = 0.869,  P  = 0.530, respectively).

Therefore, we hypothesized that vitamin D might have protective effects on beta-cell function in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), a form of slowly progressive autoimmune type 1 diabetes.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThirty-five patients with LADA were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous insulin alone (n = 18) or insulin plus 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1-alpha(OH)D3; 0.5 microg per day) (n = 17) for 1 year.

Seventy percent of patients treated with 1-alpha(OH)D3 maintained or increased their FCP concentrations after 1 year of treatment, while only 22% of patients treated with insulin alone maintained stable FCP levels (P < 0.01). Further analysis on LADA subgroups with different durations of diabetes demonstrated that islet beta-cell function was better preserved (as reflected by significantly higher FCP and PCP levels) in the 1-alpha(OH)D3 plus insulin group only in patients with diabetes duration no longer than 1 year. No severe side effects were observed in any group.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nOur data suggest that 1-alpha(OH)D3 plus insulin therapy can preserve pancreatic beta-cell function in patients with LADA.",

Hashimoto thyroiditis is the commonest cause of goitre in iodine-sufficient regions.[1] The aetiology of Hashimoto disease is very poorly understood. Most patients develop antibodies to a variety of thyroid antigens, the most common of which is&nbsp;anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO). Many also form antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and TSH receptor blocking antibodies (TBII). These antibodies attack the thyroid tissue, eventually leading to inadequate production of thyroid hormone. There is a small subset of the population, around 10-15% with the clinically evident disease, that are serum antibody-negative.[2][3] The mechanisms underlying the assumption that vitamin D is linked with autoimmunity are not clear but probably are associated with its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. The dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells originating from bone marrow and also a primary target for the immunomodulatory activity of vitamin D. 1,25[OH]2D has direct immunomodulatory effects at the level of the T cell vitamin D receptor. Together, these immunomodulatory effects can lead to the protection of target tissues, such as thyroid cells in autoimmune diseases. Considering that in HT, a disorder of T cell-mediated immunity, immunologic attack is triggered when thyrocytes express MHC class II surface HLA-DR antigens, a process induced by the production of Th1 type inflammatory cytokines (especially IFN-\u03b3). Moreover, at another stage, after being activated by T cells, B cells' ongoing proliferation might be inhibited and apoptosis might be induced by 1,25[OH]2D. Thus, 1,25[OH]2D might decrease antibodies that react with thyroid antigens. The exact levels of vitamin D that are sufficient to improve the immune regulatory function and lead to an effective immune response, should be investigated. Several clinical studies have reported a low vitamin D status in AITD or HT, indicating an association between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid autoimmunity. If supplementation of the Vitamin D decreased thyroid antibody titres in Vitamin D deficient subjects, in the future Vitamin D may become a part of AITDs' treatment, especially in those with Vitamin D deficiency. [4] So, our study tries to assess any potential therapeutic role of vitamin D in the management of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\n\nMost studies have shown an association between low vitamin D status and pathogenesis of AITD, especially HT. However, there are only few preliminary interventional studies for HT. whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for AITD or HT, should be evaluated. Treatment of HT mainly based on thyroid hormone supplementation, so if a beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation is identified/ confirmed, it will be helpful in the treatment of patients with HT and may be a part of treatment of HT patients.\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n\n\nEvaluating the role of vitamin D on an excessive thyroid immune response.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nStudy area: N.R.S. Medical college and hospital, Kolkata (Department of General Medicine).\nSTUDY PERIOD\n\n\n1 year (January,2019 to December,2019 Sample size: 100 patients both male and female.

Chronic illnesses like diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, malignancy. Pregnancy Study tools: Estimation from serum: TSH. Free thyroxine (FT4) 25 hydroxy vitamin D Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody' Study techniques: This is a prospective study conducted in N.R.S Medical college, Kolkata, India. Total 100 adult patients of both sexes diagnosed with HT and vitamin D deficiency (vit D&lt;30 ng/ml)12, having none of the exclusion criteria and getting treatment on out-patient department basis, who gave informed consent were included in our study. Blood samples drawn for anti TPO antibody and 25hydroxy vitamin D from all the participants. The correlations between serum Vit D and anti TPO antibody were measured and presented by correlation coef ficient (r2). Study participants are randomly assigned into two groups by random permuted block. Cholecalciferol supplement given in the dose of 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks in one group (n = 50). Another group (n = 50) were given placebo (empty soft gelatine capsule). At the onset of the study, patients were requested to keep their habitual diet and routine level of physical activity throughout the study period and not to take any medication that might affect their reproductive physiology. Compliance to the consumption of supplement and placebo was examined by empty blister packets. However, 2 patients from cholecalciferol group and 1 patient from control group lost to follow up. After 8 weeks blood anti TPO antibody level measured in both the groups (n = 48 &amp; 49 in 2 group). The change in the mean value of anti TPO antibody measured and statistical significance of the change checked. Results considered significant or non-significant when P&gt; or &lt; 0.05, respectively.

The Negative Correlation was found between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/ml) vs Serum TSH (mU/L) which was statistically significant. Distribution of mean serum anti-TPO antibody level (IU/ml) [mean\u00b1SD] in both groups before and after intervention <img src=\"https://www.japi.org/article/images/2023-01-08_1673190869.png\" style=\"width: 274px;\"> Reduction of serum anti-TPO antibody level in cholecalciferol group is 30.5% and reduction of serum anti-TPO antibody level in placebo group is 16.5%.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThis study is carried out with the total no. of 100 outdoor based patients of diagnosed Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (elevated Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody) and vitamin D deficiency (vit D &lt; 30 ng/mL)12 in Nil Ratan Sircar medical college and hospital within the mentioned study period. The study focussed on evaluating the role of vitamin D on an excessive thyroid immune response i.e. the effect of vitamin D supplementation on thyroid autoimmunity and that low vitamin D levels and the risk of HT are closely associated and the potential application of vitamin D in the treatment of AITD. The result demonstrates a negative Correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/mL) vs anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) which was statistically significant. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)= -0.775, p value = 0.0001. Goswami et al. conducted a community-based survey on 642 adults to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin D concentrations and thyroid autoimmunity. Their results highlighted a significant inverse association between 25(OH)D3 and TPO Ab levels [40]. This inverse correlation was substantiated in the following studies.[5-8] As regards thyroid function in the context of HT, Mackawy and co-workers demonstrated a strong negative association between serum vitamin D concentrations and TSH levels, leading to speculate that vitamin D deficiency in HT patients could be associated with a progression towards hypothyroidism (TSH &gt; 5.0 m UI/L) [45]. Our study also demonstrates negative Correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/mL) vs Serum TSH (mU/L) and the result was statistically significant. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) = -0.301, p value = 0.003. So, the results indicate that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Mean (mean\u00b1 s.d.) Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) before intervention was 545.06\u00b1 230.82 and after cholecalciferol supplementation the mean value decreased to 378.6\u00b1 160.49. So, there is a 30.5% reduction in the mean value of anti TPO antibody level. Difference of mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/mL) was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). In the placebo group the mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) (mean \u00b1 s.d.) of patients was 686.97\u00b1 290.19 and after 8 weeks of placebo the mean value was 573.1 \u00b1 254.09. So, in the placebo group the reduction is only 16.5%. Difference of mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). Therefore, in line with the hypothesis the data contributes clearer understanding that vitamin D supplementation results in a reduction of thyroid autoimmunity. This result also supports the previous research. Simsek et al. prospectively evaluated 82 patients with HT randomized in two groups: the first group treated with cholecalciferol for one month and the second group without vitamin D replacement. Their results showed that TPO Ab and Tg Ab levels were significantly decreased by the vitamin D replacement therapy in the first group [46]. These findings were also confirmed by other prospective studies and randomized controlled trials.[9-11] So, the result of our study clearly indicates that vitamin D supplementation could exert a positive effect on thyroid function as well as thyroid autoimmunity Limitations: Vitamin D status is not measured at the end of 8 weeks because of economic constraints. So, it is difficult to determine the optimal level of vitamin D needed for improving the evolution of this immunological disorder. Cholecalciferol is used in HT patients in our study, although active form calcitriol might be more beneficial as vitamin D binding protein level may affect the conversion of inactive vitamin D form and thus alters its function on immune cells. HT patients with normal vitamin D level have been excluded from the study, so from our study we cannot comment on beneficial effect of vit D supplementation in HT patient with normal vit D level. As we used empiric dose of levothyroxine in both the groups instead of a fixed dose, we could not analyze the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in reduction of serum TSH in HT There is still a gap in the knowledge regarding the potential of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of HT patients whether vitamin D supplementation will help in decreasing the replacement dose of levothyroxine or whether it will stop the need of levothyroxine replacement if used in early stages of HT.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe 8 weeks randomized; double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrates a negative correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D vs anti TPO antibody level. Treatment with 60,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for 8 weeks, is associated with significant decrease in antithyroid antibody titers. It also improved serum TSH level compared with the placebo, i.e. supplementary treatment with cholecalciferol seems to have beneficial effects on AITD. However, large multicentre studies are needed to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementary treatment on meaningful long-term clinical end points in AITD. References Dana L.

However, whether vit-D supplementation is linked to reduction of thyroid autoantibodies and improvement of thyroid function is not well characterized. The present study was planned to evaluate the effect of vit-D supplementation on possible improvement of thyroid autoantibody titer and thyroid hormone profile in patients with AITD subjects.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTwenty-three patients of HT were given weekly supplementation of 60,000 IU vit-D for 8 weeks followed by once a month for another 4 months. After 6 months of vit-D supplementation, thyroid autoantibody titer (TPO antibody) and thyroid hormone profile was rechecked.\nRESULTS\n\n\nMean serum vit-D was increased significantly from 15.33 \u00b1 5.71 to 41.22 \u00b1 12.24 ng/mL (normal levels) after supplementation. There was significant increase in thyroid autoantibody titre (from 746.8 \u00b1 332.2 to 954.1 \u00b14 59.8 IU/ml;  P  = 0.006) and TSH level (7.23 \u00b1 3.16 to 3.04 \u00b1 2.62 (mIU/L);  P  = 0.01) following 6 months of vit-D supplementation.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nVitamin-D levels were low in AITD patients in eastern India and, its supplementation in HT patients increased thyroid antibody titer and there was significant reduction in serum TSH and increased in free T4.",

The first aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between symptoms of POTS and panic disorder. The second aim was to delineate clinical features distinguishing symptoms of POTS from panic disorder. A total of 11 patients with POTS and 11 control subjects participated in an IRB-approved, prospective, placebo-controlled study. The experimentally induced panic-like symptoms of POTS were systematically studied using the Acute Panic Inventory (API) questionnaire. The participants answered the questionnaire after each placebo infusion and after each of the three provoking stimuli: head-up tilt test (HUT), isoproterenol infusion (ISI), and sodium lactate infusion (SLI). API responses were summed for each subject at each time point of administration. Individual API symptoms and summed responses were analyzed for statistical significance. All patients with POTS developed symptoms of orthostatic intolerance during HUT. Pharmacologically induced symptoms subjectively mimicked spontaneous symptoms in 5 of 11 patients during ISI and in none of 11 patients during SLI. In contrast, API scores in these patients reached panic threshold in 0 of 11 following HUT, in 4 of 11 following ISI and in 4 of 11 following SLI. Individual symptoms analysis revealed that significant increase in scores was limited to the somatic symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and twitching or trembling. In conclusion, the symptoms of POTS are phenomenologically different and clinically distinguishable from panic disorder symptoms.",

        "a2_doc": "PURPOSE\n\n\nPostural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) in adults is defined as symptoms of chronic orthostatic intolerance (COI) and autonomic dysfunction (AD) with heart rate (HR) increase of 30 beats per minute (bpm), or HR\u2009>\u2009120\u00a0bpm, during prolonged upright position. However, in adolescents, POTS is defined as symptoms of OI and AD with HR increase of \u2265\u200940\u00a0bpm, based on tilt table data. We assessed frequency of COI symptoms in pediatric patients versus HR criteria on prolonged standing to evaluate using criteria of increased HR of 30-39\u00a0bpm versus \u2265\u200940\u00a0bpm in our POTS Program.\nMETHODS\n\n\nPatients with COI with symptoms for >\u20093\u00a0months plus HR increase of \u2265\u200930\u00a0bpm on 10 min stand aged \u2264\u200918\u00a0years at diagnosis were included. Patients were divided into two groups: those with HR increase of 30-39\u00a0bpm, and those with HR increase of \u2265\u200940\u00a0bpm or upright HR of >\u2009120\u00a0bpm. A total of 28 symptoms described prior to diagnosis were evaluated using chi-square testing to assess for significant differences.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOnly insomnia was found to be significantly different between the two groups. The other 27 symptoms showed no significant difference as a function of HR.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThere are minimal statistically significant differences and no clinical differences between patients as a function of HR increase during standing. Thus, a 40-bpm threshold for adolescents on standing test may be too high, or a specific HR criteria threshold is neither predictive nor definitive in diagnosing POTS.",

Materials and Methods:  Seventy-eight patients (9-14 years) who presented with orthostatic intolerance symptoms were enrolled. Forty-three patients were diagnosed as POTS (\u0394HR \u226540 bpm), and 35 patients were assigned to the non-POTS group (\u0394HR <40 bpm). Twenty-six healthy children served as the control group. All subjects completed three standing tests in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Orthostatic HR parameters were analyzed to predict the diagnosis of POTS. Additionally, 41 patients were recruited as an external validation group.  Results:  Orthostatic HR increments in both the POTS and non-POTS groups exhibited diurnal variability, which was markedly larger in the morning ( P  < 0.05), whereas it did not differ with the time of day in the control group. Among the POTS patients, 100% met the diagnostic criteria for POTS in the morning, 44.2% in the afternoon, and 27.9% in the evening. Almost half of the POTS patients (51.2%) displayed a positive result only in the morning standing test. However, in the three standing tests at different times, \u0394HR from 1 to 10 min after standing and \u0394HR max  were the highest in the POTS group compared with in the non-POTS and control groups ( P  < 0.05). Furthermore, the maximum \u0394HR (\u0394HR max ) and \u0394HR at 5 and 10 min in the afternoon and evening standing tests yielded moderate predictive values for the POTS diagnosis. The external validation test showed that the afternoon \u0394HR max  \u226530 bpm to diagnose POTS yielded sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85, 71.4, and 78%, respectively, and the evening \u0394HR max  \u226525 bpm yielded sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85, 76.2, and 80.5%, respectively.  Conclusions:  The orthostatic HR increment exhibits diurnal variability in children and adolescents with POTS that may affect the diagnosis of POTS.

It affects around 0.2% of the population, most commonly women aged 13 to 50\u2009years. POTS can be debilitating; prolonged episodes of pre-syncope and fatigue can severely affect activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Medical treatment is limited and not supported by randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence. Lifestyle interventions are first-line treatment, including increased fluid and salt intake, compression tights and isometric counter-pressure manoeuvres to prevent fainting. Observational studies and small RCTs suggest exercise training may improve symptoms and HRQoL in POTS, but evidence quality is low.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSixty-two people (aged 18-40\u2009years) with a confirmed diagnosis of POTS will be invited to enrol on a feasibility RCT with embedded qualitative study. The primary outcome will be feasibility; process-related measures will include the number of people eligible, recruited, randomised and withdrawn, along with indicators of exercise programme adherence and acceptability. Secondary physiological, clinical and health-related outcomes including sub-maximal recumbent bike exercise test, active stand test and HRQoL will be measured at 4 and 7\u2009months post-randomisation by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The PostUraL tachycardia Syndrome Exercise (PULSE) intervention consists of (1) individual assessment; (2) 12-week, once to twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; (3) behavioural and motivational support; and (4) guided lifestyle physical activity.

We aimed to study cardiac autonomic nervous system functioning in head-up tilt (HUT) in adolescents with POTS to find out if parasympathetic tone is attenuated in the upright position.  Methods:  We compared characteristics of a group of 25 (females 14/25; 56%) adolescents with POTS and 12 (females 4/12; 34%) without POTS aged 9-17 years. We compared heart rate variability with high- and low-frequency oscillations, and their temporal changes in HUT.  Results:  The high-frequency oscillations, i.e., HF, attenuated in both groups during HUT ( p  < 0.05), but the attenuation was bigger in POTS ( p  = 0.04). In the beginning of HUT, low-frequency oscillations, i.e., LF, increased more in POTS ( p  = 0.01), but in the end of HUT, an attenuation in LF was seen in the POTS group ( p  < 0.05), but not in the subjects without POTS. There were no associations of previous infections or vaccinations with POTS. Subjects with POTS were sleepier and their overall quality of life was very low.

The original trial protocol was published in BMC Pilot & Feasibility Studies (accessible at https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-020-00702-1 ). The PULSE intervention consists of (1) individual assessment; (2) 12-week, twice-weekly, supervised exercise training; (3) behavioural and motivational support; and (4) guided lifestyle physical activity.

Secondary physiological, clinical and health-related outcomes will be assessed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, here we describe amendments to the trial protocol.\nMETHODS\n\n\nRestrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was necessary to change the delivery of the PULSE and control interventions. These changes reflected the need to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission in a clinical population, some of whom were at increased risk of contracting the virus and suffering serious illness. The major change was that the originally intended centre-based PULSE and control interventions would now be delivered remotely on-line. Subsequently, there were minor changes to the participant eligibility criteria. These decisions followed an on-line co-creation session with people affected by PoTS, and relevant public and professional stakeholders.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe present an update of the original trial protocol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. No participants were recruited to the original protocol; thus, results will reflect the on-line delivery of the intervention.

Calf blood flow and size change were measured during 70 degrees head-up tilt.\nRESULTS\n\n\nResting calf venous pressure was higher in the POTS group compared with the control group. Resting resistance was decreased in both the forearm (15 +/- 2 vs 30 +/- 4) and calf (27 +/- 2 vs 42 +/- 5) in the POTS group. Calf blood flow 60 seconds after tilt increased from 1.9 +/- 0.4 mL/100 mL/min to 6.6 +/- 2.3 mL/100 mL/min in the POTS group but only by half in the control group.

Baseline data included norepinephrine plasma levels, autonomic testing and baseline cognitive function in a seated position [the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Leistungspr\u00fcfsystem (LPS) subtests 1 and 2, and the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP)]. Cognitive functioning was examined in a randomized order in supine, upright and upright legs crossed position.

I took my heart rate three times while laying in bed. at 1:37am, by heart rate was 73bpm. at 1:39am, my heart rate was 74bpm. at 1:40am, my heart rate was 73 bpm again. I then stood up (right next to my bed) and proceeded to take my heart rate again. Immediately it shot up to more than double my resting heart rate at 1:41am my heart rate was 156bpm i took it again a minute later and at 1:42am my heart rate was 153bpm. Even if its not pots, just from standing up, I feel like this is not a normal bodily response for the majority of the population. Dont know how to go about getting this checked out. By the way, not sure if it matters, but I am a 19 year old girl.",
