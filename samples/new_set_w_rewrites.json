        "a1_doc": "The relationships between seizure severity change and patient characteristics, changes in seizure frequency, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may be important for determining the overall impact of medication therapy on patients with epilepsy. The objectives of these post hoc analyses of the global Phase III 093-0304 trial (NCT00988429, Study 304) of adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in patients with refractory focal (partial-onset) seizures (FS) were to evaluate associations between seizure severity change, measured by the Seizure Severity Questionnaire (SSQ), and 1) patient characteristics, 2) seizure frequency change, standardized as the seizure frequency (SSF) per 28-day period, and 3) change in HRQoL, evaluated by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The analyses were conducted on the per-protocol population (PPP) of patients who were randomized to a placebo arm (n\u202f=\u202f188) or an ESL-active group that included treatment with adjunctive ESL 800\u202fmg once daily (QD; n\u202f=\u202f184) or adjunctive ESL 1200\u202fmg QD (n\u202f=\u202f175). General linear models (GLM) were used to measure the association between SSQ change and patient baseline characteristics or percentage change in the SSF from baseline. Associations between changes in the SSQ and changes in the QOLIE-31 and MADRS were examined using GLM with patient baseline characteristics as covariates. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients in the ESL-active group and those treated with ESL 800\u202fmg or ESL 1200\u202fmg. Minimal clinically important difference (MCIDs) thresholds were used to assess improvements in SSQ scores. The analyses included 547 per-protocol patients. Patients using 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) at baseline had greater improvements in the SSQ compared with those receiving 2 AEDs (P\u202f=\u202f0.0606). Treatment with ESL 1200\u202fmg was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in the SSQ (P\u202f=\u202f0.0005). The SSQ improvements were significantly associated with an SSF reduction of \u226575%, compared with no reduction (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001). In the PPP and the ESL-active group, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 Total Score (TS; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the Seizure Worry (SW; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Social Functioning (SF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0030) subscales. In the ESL 1200\u202fmg subgroup, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the SW (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Energy/Fatigue (EF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0007) subscales. In the ESL 800\u202fmg subgroup, improvements in the SSQ were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f=\u202f0.0362) and the SW (P\u202f=\u202f0.0241) subscale. There was no significant association between changes in the SSQ and changes in the MADRS in patients treated with ESL. These findings demonstrated that in this clinical trial population, adding ESL to baseline AED therapy had utility for decreasing seizure severity and improving HRQoL. There were no significant associations between changes in seizure severity and changes in depressive symptoms in patients with FS.",

        "a2_doc": "In order to compare the multiple-dose bioavailability of carbamazepine (CBZ) from 2 slow-release preparations, Neurotol slow and Tegretol Retard, a single-blind, randomized, cross-over study was carried out. 21 adult patients with epilepsy were enrolled in the study. At the end of both 2-week treatment periods, a blood sample series was drawn after the administration of the morning CBZ dose. The serum concentrations of CBZ, CBZ-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxy-CBZ (CBZD) were measured using HPLC. The mean bioavailability of CBZ from Neurotol slow was 11% (P = 0.002) higher than from Tegretol Retard. Owing to the better bioavailability, the peak (Cmax), lowest (Cmin) and mean (Css) concentrations of CBZ were also significantly higher during Neurotol slow treatment. Fluctuation of serum CBZ concentrations (Cmax-Cmin/Css, ADCss/AUC0-12h) did not differ significantly between the 2 treatments; neither did tmax. Similar results were obtained with CBZE and CBZD. There were more epileptic seizures on Tegretol Retard than on Neurotol slow, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that there are significant differences in the bioavailability of CBZ from these 2 slow-release preparations.",

Testing at baseline and after 12 weeks of vigabatrin (n = 83) or placebo (n = 85) used eight measures of cognitive abilities and three of mood and adjustment. The vigabatrin and placebo groups were highly similar at entry into the study. At the end of the study, there were no differences between the vigabatrin and placebo groups on any cognitive variable or on any measure of mood and adjustment. Analysis of the results related to relief from seizures demonstrated only chance findings. In a similar manner, there were no relationships between vigabatrin serum levels at the end of the study and changes on measures of abilities and adjustment. Vigabatrin appears to be a useful antiepilepsy drug with little impact upon tests of either cognitive abilities or quality of life.",

Group A consisted of 20 seizure-free (from 5 months to 2 years) patients and group B of 20 patients with seizures refractory to drug therapy. In group A, four patients had seizures, two on both Epitol and Tegretol and two on Tegretol. In group B, the average seizure frequencies were 0.25 seizures per day on Epitol and 0.22 seizures per day on Tegretol. Average seizure frequencies were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p less than 0.05). Areas under the curve were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p = 0.05). Average peak heights were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p less than 0.05). Average time to peak was earlier with Epitol.

After an 8-week baseline period, patients were randomized 2:1 to ganaxolone 1,500\u00a0mg/day or placebo for a 10-week treatment period (2-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance) followed by either tapering or entry into an open-label extension study. The primary endpoint was mean weekly seizure frequency. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients experiencing \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency (responder rate), percent change in mean weekly seizure frequency, seizure-free days, and quality of life. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 147 randomized patients (98 ganaxolone, 49 placebo), 131 completed the study; 95% of participants titrated up to 1,500\u00a0mg/day and 78% maintained this dose. From baseline to endpoint, mean weekly seizure frequency decreased with ganaxolone (6.5-5.2) versus placebo (9.2-10.8), representing an 11.4% decrease versus placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0489, analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). Mean percent change from baseline was -17.6% with ganaxolone versus 2.0% with placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0144, Kruskal-Wallis test). Responder rates were 24% with ganaxolone versus 15% with placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19). Discontinuation due to adverse events was similar with ganaxolone (7.1%) and placebo (6.1%). Common adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and included dizziness (16.3% vs. 8.2%), fatigue (16.3% vs. 8.2%), and somnolence (13.3% vs. 2.0%).\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nGanaxolone 1,500\u00a0mg/day reduced partial-onset seizure frequency and was generally safe and well tolerated in this phase 2 study. These results support continued development of ganaxolone for adult patients with refractory partial-onset seizures.",

        "a7_doc": "The metabolic effects of ethanol on treadmill performance were determined in four trained runners. Ethanol in doses of 25 mL in 150 mL of grapefruit juice (total volume) or grapefruit juice was randomly administered 10 minutes before and at 30 minutes of a 60-minute treadmill run. The speed and grade of the treadmill was adjusted to elicit an average oxygen consumption (VO2) of 80 to 85% of the subjects' VO2max. Three of the four subjects could not complete the treadmill run after the administration of ethanol. Administration of ethanol resulted in significant increases in the heart rate responses to treadmill running above those for the placebo grapefruit treatment. VO2 was higher after ethanol administration than the placebo grapefruit juice treatment, but these values were not significant. Blood glucose content rose significantly between 0 and 30 minutes of treadmill running for both the ethanol and placebo grapefruit juice treatments. Between 30 minutes of treadmill running and the termination of the exercise, the blood glucose level decreased significantly by 24% after the second ethanol treatment at 30 minutes of exercise. Plasma fatty acid, triglyceride, creatine phosphokinase, and renin contents followed expected exercise changes. It was concluded that the administration of ethanol adversely influenced treadmill exercise performance by eliciting a hypoglycemic effect between 30 minutes and the termination of the exercise.",

The primary end point was time to seizure, and the primary objective was to establish noninferiority of TPM to PHT in the risk of seizure.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt day 28, the estimated seizure-free rate was 81.1% for TPM treatment in comparison with 90.3% for PHT treatment. Noninferiority of TPM to PHT (primary objective) could not be established [hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98 to 4.12, p = 0.366), and PHT could not be shown to be superior to TPM. A higher percentage discontinued with PHT compared to TPM for all reasons (21.1 vs. 12.8%) and due to adverse events (13.4 vs. 6.8%). The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were dizziness, paresthesia, and somnolence. A post hoc analysis showed that TPM was superior to PHT in time to discontinuation (retention rate) for all causes (89.4% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study was inconclusive in establishing noninferiority of TPM 100 mg/day compared to a standard regimen of oral PHT in seizure risk in this population of patients with new-onset epilepsy. Given the superiority of TPM in overall retention and favorable tolerability without titration, it may nonetheless be an appropriate option in some patients with new-onset epilepsy requiring rapid treatment initiation.",

        "a9_doc": "The influence of single oral dosages of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid, vigabatrin (VGB), lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), and losigamone (LSG) on visual perception was investigated in ten healthy volunteers according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. The test battery comprised visual acuity, the Lanthony-D-15-d\u00e9satur\u00e9 colour perception test, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia threshold measurements, perception threshold assessment for monochromatic and chromatic gaussian dots, monochromatic gratings and gratings of differing spatial frequency, and critical flicker fusion tests with various stimuli. The only consistent and partly significant effects were seen after VGB and GBP. After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile. The other tests were not influenced consistently by any antiepileptic drug (AED). We conclude that: (i) gamma-amino-butyric acid-(GABA)-related properties as under the prototype drug VGB result in specific alterations of the transient tritanopia phenomenon which is consistent with the physiological hypothesis for this retinal paradigm based on extracellular recordings in primates. The possible mechanisms why VGB improved critical flicker fusion as the only AED in this trial are discussed. The profile of GBP indicates a unique mechanism of action. We have not observed specific influences on visual perception under AEDs which act mainly via alterations of ion membrane conductance. The transient tritanopia and flicker fusion paradigms we used appear to be promising to investigate antiepileptic drugs with hitherto unknown modes of actions in human noninvasively.",

To be included in the study, patients were required to have experienced four or more partial-onset seizures during a 4-week prospective baseline, despite treatment with 1-2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive BRV 50 mg/day (BRV50), 150 mg/day (BRV150), or placebo. A 3-week up-titration period was followed by a 7-week maintenance period (total treatment period of 10 weeks).\nKEY FINDINGS\n\n\nA total of 157 patients were randomized (intent-to-treat [ITT] population; BRV50 n = 53, BRV150 n = 52, placebo n = 52) and overall 148 (94.3%) completed the study. The percent reduction in baseline-adjusted partial-onset seizure frequency/week over placebo during the 7-week maintenance period (primary efficacy outcome) did not reach statistical significance (14.7% for BRV50 [p = 0.093] and 13.6% for BRV150 [p = 0.124]). However, during the entire 10-week treatment period a statistically significant difference was observed for both BRV groups (17.7% for BRV50 [p = 0.026] and 16.3% for BRV150 [p = 0.043]). The median percent reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency/week during the maintenance period was 38.2% for BRV50 (p = 0.017) and 30.0% for BRV150 (p = 0.113) versus 18.9% in the placebo group. During the treatment period, this was 34.9% for BRV50 (p = 0.004) and 28.3% for BRV150 (p = 0.070) compared with 16.3% for placebo. Fifty percent responder rates during the maintenance period were 23.1% for placebo compared with 39.6% for BRV50 (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, p = 0.077) and 33.3% for BRV150 (OR 1.66, p = 0.261). During the treatment period, 50% responder rates were 17.3% for placebo compared with 35.8% for BRV50 (OR 2.69, p = 0.038) and 30.8% for BRV150 (OR 2.15, p = 0.114). Nine patients were free from partial-onset seizures during the 10-week treatment period (five patients [9.4%] in the BRV50 group and three [5.8%] in the BRV150 group compared with one patient [1.9%] in the placebo group). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported during the treatment period were mostly mild-to-moderate with similar incidence across treatment groups (BRV50 36/53, 67.9%; BRV150 35/52, 67.3%; placebo 37/52, 71.2%). The most frequently reported TEAEs in BRV groups were headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, nausea, somnolence, and dizziness, although nausea had a higher incidence in the placebo group.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb study of adjunctive BRV (50 and 150 mg/day) in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, the primary efficacy analysis did not reach statistical significance; however, statistically significant differences compared with placebo were observed on several secondary efficacy outcomes.

Ivermectin has been recommended widely as a treatment of COVID-19, but whether it has clinically significant antiviral activity in vivo is uncertain.\nMethods\n\n\nIn a multicentre open label, randomized, controlled adaptive platform trial, adult patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 were randomized to one of six treatment arms including high-dose oral ivermectin (600 \u00b5g/kg daily for 7 days), the monoclonal antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab (600 mg/600 mg), and no study drug. The primary outcome was the comparison of viral clearance rates in the modified intention-to-treat population. This was derived from daily log 10  viral densities in standardized duplicate oropharyngeal swab eluates. This ongoing trial is registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT05041907).\nResults\n\n\nRandomization to the ivermectin arm was stopped after enrolling 205 patients into all arms, as the prespecified futility threshold was reached. Following ivermectin, the mean estimated rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance was 9.1% slower (95% confidence interval [CI] -27.2% to +11.8%; n=45) than in the no drug arm (n=41), whereas in a preliminary analysis of the casirivimab/imdevimab arm it was 52.3% faster (95% CI +7.0% to +115.1%; n=10 (Delta variant) vs. n=41).\nConclusions\n\n\nHigh-dose ivermectin did not have measurable antiviral activity in early symptomatic COVID-19. Pharmacometric evaluation of viral clearance rate from frequent serial oropharyngeal qPCR viral density estimates is a highly efficient and well-tolerated method of assessing SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapeutics in vitro.\nFunding\n\n\n'Finding treatments for COVID-19: A phase 2 multi-centre adaptive platform trial to assess antiviral pharmacodynamics in early symptomatic COVID-19 (PLAT-COV)' is supported by the Wellcome Trust Grant ref: 223195/Z/21/Z through the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator.\nClinical trial number\n\n\nNCT05041907.",

Among 1057 patients randomized (median age, 53 years [IQR, 42-62], 20% were \u226565 years of age, and 65% Latinx), the median duration of follow-up was 103 days for sotrovimab and 102 days for placebo.

We conducted a phase 2, double-blind study evaluating the antiviral activity, safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of bemnifosbuvir in ambulatory patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Patients were randomized 1:1 to bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg or placebo (cohort A) and 3:1 to bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg or placebo (cohort B); all doses were given twice daily for 5\u2009days. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in the amount of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The modified intent-to-treat infected population comprised 100 patients (bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg,  n\u2009 =\u200930; bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg,  n\u2009 =\u200930; cohort A placebo,  n\u2009 =\u200930; cohort B placebo,  n\u2009 =\u200910).

Bemnifosbuvir 550\u2009mg was well tolerated. Incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher with bemnifosbuvir 1,100\u2009mg (10.0% and 16.7% of patients, respectively) than pooled placebo (2.5% nausea, 2.5% vomiting). In the primary analysis, bemnifosbuvir did not show meaningful antiviral activity on nasopharyngeal viral load as measured by RT-PCR compared with placebo in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT04709835.  IMPORTANCE  COVID-19 continues to be a major global public health challenge, and there remains a need for effective and convenient direct-acting antivirals that can be administered outside health care settings. Bemnifosbuvir is an oral antiviral with a dual mechanism of action and potent  in vitro  activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity, safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of bemnifosbuvir in ambulatory patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. In the primary analysis, bemnifosbuvir did not show meaningful antiviral activity compared with placebo as assessed by nasopharyngeal viral loads. The negative predictive value of nasopharyngeal viral load reduction for clinical outcomes in COVID-19 is currently unclear, and further evaluation of bemnifosbuvir for COVID-19 may be warranted despite the findings observed in this study.",

Here, we aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of an inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine (VLA2001) after primary vaccination with 2 doses of either VLA2001 or ChAdOx1-S (Oxford-Astra Zeneca), including the cross-neutralization capacity against the Delta and Omicron VoCs.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis interim analysis of an open-label extension of a randomized, controlled phase 3 trial assessed a single booster dose of an inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine (VLA2001) in healthy or medically stable adults aged 18 years and above, recruited in 21 clinical sites in the UK, who had previously received two doses of either VLA2001 or ChAdOx1-S. Safety outcomes were frequency and severity of solicited injection site and systemic reactions within 7 days after booster vaccination as well as frequency and severity of any unsolicited adverse events (AE) after up to 6 months. Immunogenicity outcomes were the immune response to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 assessed 14 days post booster expressed as geometric mean titres (GMT), GMT fold ratios and seroconversion of specific neutralizing antibodies and S-protein binding IgG antibodies. Immunogenicity against the Delta and Omicron VoCs was assessed as a post-hoc outcome with a pseudovirus neutralization antibody assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04864561, and is ongoing.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was administered to 958 participants, of whom 712 had been primed with VLA2001, and 246 with ChAdOx1-S. Within 7 days following these booster doses, 607 (63.4%) participants reported solicited injection site reactions, and 487 (50.8%) reported solicited systemic reactions. Up to 14 days post booster, 751 (78.4%) participants reported at least one adverse event. The tolerability profile of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar in VLA2001-primed and ChAdOx1-S-primed participants. In VLA2001-primed participants, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 32.5 (22.8, 46.3) immediately before to 521.5 (413.0, 658.6) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, this corresponds to a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 27.7 (20.0, 38.5). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 3.6 (2.8, 4.7). In the ChAdOx1-S primed group, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 65.8 (43.9, 98.4) immediately before to 188.3 (140.3, 252.8) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 3.0 (2.2, 4.0). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 1.6 (1.1, 2.2). For S-protein binding IgG antibodies, the pre- versus post-booster GMT fold ratio (95% CI) was 34.6 (25.0, 48.0) in the VLA2001-primed group and 4.0 (3.0, 5.2) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMT fold rise of IgG antibodies was 3.8 (3.2, 4.6) in the VLA2001-primed group and 1.2 (0.9, 1.6) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. The GMT against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.4/5) increased from 4.2 to 260, and from 2.7 to 56.7, respectively, when boosting subjects previously primed with VLA2001. Following the boost, 97% of subjects primed with VLA2001 had detectable Delta- and 94% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S, the GMT against Delta and Omicron titres increased from 9.1 to 92.5, and from 3.6 to 12.3, respectively. After boosting, 99% of subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S had detectable Delta- and 70% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In both VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S primed subjects, the additional VLA2001 dose boosted T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens to levels above those observed before the booster dose.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was safe and well tolerated after primary immunization with VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S. The tolerability of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar to the favourable profile observed after the first and second priming doses. Both in a homologous and a heterologous setting, boosting resulted in higher neutralizing antibody titres than after primary immunization and significant increases in cross-neutralization titres against Delta and Omicron were observed after the booster dose. These data support the use of VLA2001 in booster programmes in ChadOx1-S primed groups.",

We aimed to compare the efficacy of interferon beta-1a in combination with remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at 63 hospitals across five countries (Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, and the USA). Eligible patients were hospitalised adults (aged \u226518 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test, and who met one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection: the presence of radiographic infiltrates on imaging, a peripheral oxygen saturation on room air of 94% or less, or requiring supplemental oxygen. Patients were excluded if they had either an alanine aminotransferase or an aspartate aminotransferase concentration more than five times the upper limit of normal; had impaired renal function; were allergic to the study product; were pregnant or breast feeding; were already on mechanical ventilation; or were anticipating discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital within 72 h of enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous remdesivir as a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose administered daily for up to 9 days and up to four doses of either 44 \u03bcg interferon beta-1a (interferon beta-1a group plus remdesivir group) or placebo (placebo plus remdesivir group) administered subcutaneously every other day. Randomisation was stratified by study site and disease severity at enrolment. Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to interferon beta-1a and placebo treatment; remdesivir treatment was given to all patients without masking. The primary outcome was time to recovery, defined as the first day that a patient attained a category 1, 2, or 3 score on the eight-category ordinal scale within 28 days, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomised patients who were classified according to actual clinical severity. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04492475.\nFINDINGS\n\n\nBetween Aug 5, 2020, and Nov 11, 2020, 969 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group (n=487) or to the placebo plus remdesivir group (n=482). The mean duration of symptoms before enrolment was 8\u00b77 days (SD 4\u00b74) in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group and 8\u00b75 days (SD 4\u00b73) days in the placebo plus remdesivir group. Patients in both groups had a time to recovery of 5 days (95% CI not estimable) (rate ratio of interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group vs placebo plus remdesivir 0\u00b799 [95% CI 0\u00b787-1\u00b713]; p=0\u00b788). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of mortality at 28 days was 5% (95% CI 3-7%) in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group and 3% (2-6%) in the placebo plus remdesivir group (hazard ratio 1\u00b733 [95% CI 0\u00b769-2\u00b755]; p=0\u00b739). Patients who did not require high-flow oxygen at baseline were more likely to have at least one related adverse event in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group (33 [7%] of 442 patients) than in the placebo plus remdesivir group (15 [3%] of 435). In patients who required high-flow oxygen at baseline, 24 (69%) of 35 had an adverse event and 21 (60%) had a serious adverse event in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group compared with 13 (39%) of 33 who had an adverse event and eight (24%) who had a serious adverse event in the placebo plus remdesivir group.\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nInterferon beta-1a plus remdesivir was not superior to remdesivir alone in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

The effects of nasal packing on post-operative sinonasal mucosal healing remain unknown in humans.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nThis study aims to compare the histopathalogical effects of Merocel and Merocel covered with a finger glove on mucosal healing, and patients` discomfort immediately post-operatively after endoscopic sinus surgery and at removal of the nasal packing.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThirty-seven patients with chronic rhinosinusitis undergoing bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery were enrolled in a prospective study. Patients were randomized and blinded to receive Merocel middle meatal spacer (MMMS) in one nostril and finger glove Merocel middle meatal spacer (FGMMS) in the contra lateral side. Patients were seen on post-operative day 6, and completed a visual analogue score reporting the post-operative discomfort from nasal packing on each side. Following the removal of nasal packing, patients indicated which side caused more discomfort on removal. Biopsies were taken from the middle turbinates and sent to a blinded pathologist who scored the level of mucosal inflammation from 0 - 4.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference between MMMS and FGMMS in regards to their effect on sinonasal mucosal inflammation and discomfort post-operatively. A statistically significant difference was noted with respect to discomfort at removal with the uncovered Merocel more likely to cause discomfort when compared to the Merocel covered in a glove finger.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nMMMS and FGMMS are equivalent in the amount of sinonasal mucosal inflammation and discomfort post endoscopic sinus surgery.

The exhalation delivery system with fluticasone (EDS-FLU) may improve care by increasing superior/posterior intranasal corticosteroid deposition.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of EDS-FLU versus EDS-placebo in patients with nasal polyps (NP). Coprimary end points were change in nasal congestion and polyp grade. Key secondary end points were Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale-Revised (MOS Sleep-R). Other prespecified end points included all 4 cardinal symptoms of NP, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI), and key indicators for surgical intervention.\nDESIGN\n\n\nRandomized, double-blind, EDS-placebo-controlled, multicenter study.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThree hundred twenty-three subjects with NP and moderate-severe congestion/obstruction, most with history of corticosteroid use (94.4%) and/or prior surgery (60.4%), were randomized to EDS-FLU 93 \u00b5g, 186 \u00b5g, or 372 \u00b5g or EDS-placebo twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks (16 double-blind\u2009+\u20098 single-arm extension with EDS-FLU 372 \u00b5g BID).\nRESULTS\n\n\nAll EDS-FLU doses produced significant improvement in both coprimary end points ( P\u2009<\u2009.05) and in SNOT-22 total score ( P \u2264 .005). EDS-FLU significantly improved all 4 cardinal symptoms of NP ( P\u2009<\u2009.05), including congestion/obstruction, facial pain/pressure, rhinorrhea/post-nasal drip, and hyposmia/anosmia. Approximately 80% of subjects reported improvement with EDS-FLU, with 65% reporting \"much\" or \"very much\" improvement by week 16.

An ear-related measure of quality of life (QoL) [a 14-point questionnaire on the impact of OME (OMQ-14)], weekly diary recorded symptoms, compliance and adverse events were all secondary outcomes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt 1 month, the proportion of children with normal tympanograms was 47.3% (62/131) in those allocated to autoinflation and 35.6% (47/132) in those receiving usual care [adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.88]. At 3 months, the proportions were 49.6% (62/125) and 38.3% (46/120), respectively (adjusted RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.83; number needed to treat\u2009=\u20099).

Adverse events included otalgia in 4% of treated children compared with 1% in the control group. Minor nosebleeds (14% vs. 15%) and respiratory tract infections (18% vs. 13%) were noted.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nWe found the use of autoinflation in young children with OME to be feasible in primary care and effective in both clearing effusions and improving child and parent ear-related QoL and symptoms. This method has scope to be used more widely. Further research is needed for very young children, and to inform prudent use in different health settings.",

Although the use of antibiotics is widely documented, the interest of short cycles of corticosteroids in the treatment of the functional manifestations of AMRS is based on professional experience. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerance to prednisone administered for 3 days in addition to antibiotherapy in patients presenting with an AMRS.\nMETHOD\n\n\nThis was a double blind, randomised study in parallel groups and controlled versus a placebo, involving patients aged over 18, presenting with an AMRS confirmed by X-ray and endoscopy, having developed less than 5 days and complaining of spontaneous pain assessed as >or=50 millimetres on a visual analog scale (VAS). Together with cefpodoxime, the patients received either prednisone (0.8 to 1.2 mg/kg) for 3 days or a placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean of the differences versus the baseline value of pain (MPID - mean pain intensity difference) assessed on the VAS from Day 1 to Day 3. The secondary endpoints assessed were the mean of the differences in intensity of nasal obstruction, assessed in the same way as the MPID, the time lapse before the orally expressed relief of the pain (PRID - pain reflief intensity difference) and the administration of paracetamol during the first 3 days.\nRESULTS\n\n\n289 patients (placebo 147, prednisone 142) were assessable for analysis in intent-to-treat (ITT). The global spontaneous pain on inclusion, measured by a VAS was of 73.0 +/- 14.1 mm. The assessments made during the first 3 days of treatment showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the prednisone group regarding MPID: - 4.82 mm (CI 95% -9.25; -0.40) (p=0.03), nasal obstruction - 5.0 mm (CI 95% -9.1; -0.8) (p=0.02) and consumption of paracetamol (p=0.03). There was no difference between the two groups after the end of the antibiotherapy. The tolerance measured throughout the study was comparable between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study clearly showed the efficacy of a short course of oral prednisone (3 days), versus a placebo, in the treatment of the functional signs of acute maxillary rhinosinusitis with severe pain in adults in addition to an appropriate antibiotic treatment.",

The effect of acupuncture cannot be assessed by optical rhinometry (ORM).\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nIn most cases nasal congestion is caused by hypertrophy of the inferior turbinate as a result of allergic and chronic rhinitis. Topical decongestants cause severe side effects. As a consequence, there is an increasing demand for alternative treatment options such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).\nMETHODS\n\n\nA total of 25 patients with nasal congestion due to hypertrophic inferior turbinate were recruited. The mucosal swelling status of the inferior turbinate was assessed by continuous ORM for 20 min. Patients were asked to score the severity of their nasal congestion on a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and 10 and 20 min after acupuncture. Specific verum acupuncture points related to nasal congestion were tested against non-specific control sham acupuncture points.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSham acupuncture improved VAS scores, whereas ORM measured an increase in nasal swelling. The ORM revealed a quicker onset of the effect of verum acupuncture on the nasal blood flow. Also, verum acupuncture reaches its maximum effect in a shorter time period, so that the net reaction time was much shorter. However, ORM could not prove a decongestant effect of verum acupuncture on inferior turbinate.",

        "post": "Some Info on Probiotics for IBS\nSo I posted this in a comment and it was suggested that I make this info its own post. I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.\n\nFrom the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and/or severity: \n\nSaccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u00a0CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum\u00a0MIMBb75.\n\nI may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).\n\nAlso, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.\n\nBifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).\n\nA lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.\n\nIt's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.\n\nAlso, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.\n\nAnd of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor. This is just an info dump in case anyone wanted to know this stuff.\n\nHere are the links:\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00434-X/fulltext\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1590865819309594\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7279071/\n\nhttps://www.optibacprobiotics.com/learning-lab/in-depth/gut-health/which-probiotics-are-best-for-ibs#IBS-U\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00332/full#B68\n\nhttps://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/probiotics-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3296087/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33745570/\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eci.13201",

Pre- and post-treatment gastrointestinal transit measurements were performed in all patients. Patients recorded their bowel function and symptoms daily in a diary during the 10-week study, which was powered to detect a 50% change in the primary colonic transit end-point.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were no significant differences in mean gastrointestinal transit measurements, bowel function scores or satisfactory global symptom relief between the two treatment groups, pre- or post-therapy. Differences in abdominal bloating scores between treatments were borderline significant (P = 0.09, analysis of covariance). Further analysis revealed that abdominal bloating was reduced (P = 0.046) with VSL#3 [mean post- minus pre-treatment score, - 13.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), - 2.5 to - 24.9], but not with placebo (P = 0.54) (mean post- minus pre-treatment score, - 1.7; 95% CI, 7.1 to - 10.4). With the exception of changes in abdominal bloating, VSL#3 had no effect on other individual symptoms: abdominal pain, gas and urgency. All patients tolerated VSL#3 well.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nVSL#3 appears to be promising in the relief of abdominal bloating in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. This is unrelated to an alteration in gastrointestinal or colonic transit.",

Recently, it was revealed that low grade mucosal inflammation and/or immune imbalance of the lower digestive tract is one of the mechanisms involved in symptom generation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Biobran, arabinoxylan compound derived from rice bran, has been reported to have several biological actions such as anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects. So we investigated the therapeutic effects of Biobran in patients with IBS. Method. Forty patients with diarrhea predominant or mixed type IBS were randomly assigned to either a Biobran group for treatment with Biobran or a placebo group. Therapeutic efficacy and IBS symptoms were assessed subjectively by the patients after 4 weeks of administration. Results. The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P < 0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group). Biobran group showed a significant decrease in the score of diarrhea and constipation and in CRP value. However, no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. Conclusion. The administration of Biobran improved IBS symptoms. It is likely that anti-inflammatory and/or immune modulatory effects of Biobran might be useful in IBS patients.",

This study was a randomized clinical trial on 64 IBS patients. The patients were selected according to Rome III criteria and were assigned into two groups. Bowel symptom severity and frequency scale and QOL-IBS were used to investigate the patients' symptoms. The first group underwent CBT with medication therapy, and the second group received only medication. Data were analyzed using analysis of multiple covariance.

The purpose of the present study is to describe how core IBS symptoms vary over time. Twenty-five subjects (17 females, 8 males), who were not receiving treatment for IBS, rated the severity of their IBS symptoms daily for 8 weeks. Four symptoms' (abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, constipation and diarrhea) ratings were slimmed to create a primary IBS symptom score. The data were detrended, then a time-series analysis was performed. Many subjects' IBS severity was predictable over more than one day, and symptoms tended to occur in clusters rather than randomly. Anxiety and depression were slightly to moderately correlated with IBS variables, but virtually all of these correlations were nonsignificant.",

        "a9_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nConstipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder and its etiology is multifactorial. Growing evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is associated with the development of constipation. Prebiotics are subjected to bacterial fermentation in the gut to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can help relieve constipation symptoms. The prebiotic UG1601 consists of inulin, lactitol, and aloe vera gel, which are known laxatives, but randomized, controlled clinical trials that examine the effects of this supplement on gut microbiota composition are lacking.\nAIM\n\n\nTo assess the efficacy of the prebiotic UG1601 in suppressing constipation-related adverse events in subjects with mild constipation.\nMETHODS\n\n\nAdults with a stool frequency of less than thrice a week were randomized to receive either prebiotics or a placebo supplement for 4 wk. All participants provided their fecal and blood samples at baseline and at the end of intervention. Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool frequency were evaluated. The concentrations of serum endotoxemia markers and fecal SCFAs were determined. The relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and the gut microbial community in the responders and non-responders in the prebiotics supplementation group were evaluated.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms between groups, although the prebiotic group showed greater symptom improvement. However, after prebiotic usage, serum cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were significantly decreased (CD14,  P  = 0.012; LPS,  P  < 0.001). The change in LPS concentration was significantly larger in the prebiotic group than in the placebo group ( P  < 0.001). Fecal SCFAs concentrations did not differ between groups, while the relative abundance of  Roseburia hominis , a major butyrate producer, was significantly increased in the prebiotic group ( P  = 0.045). The abundances of the phylum Firmicutes and the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia) ( P  = 0.009) were decreased in the responders within the prebiotic group. In addition, the proportions of the phylum Firmicutes, the class Clostridia, and the order Clostridiales were inversely correlated with several fecal SCFAs ( P  < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAlterations in gut microbiota composition, including a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria, following prebiotic UG1601 supplementation might help alleviate symptom scores and endotoxemia.",

        "a10_doc": "BACKGROUND Inflammatory bowel diseases are managed by different methods, which may not be well tolerated because of their side effects. Recently, pro-prebiotics are considered as a supplementary treatment in gastrointestinal diseases. In this study, the effect of Lactocare\u00ae (ZistTakhmir Company) was investigated on the disease severity in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial (Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials number: IRCT201407271264N5), 60 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis were included. An 8-week trial was carried out comparing Lactocare\u00ae as a supplement with standard therapy against placebo. Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) was measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using paired ttest to assess the temporal changes (before and after the treatment) in the mean of SCCAI in each group. Chi-square test was used to compare the response rates. Odds ratios (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were also calculated. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS A significant decreased mean SCCAI was seen in the intervention group (4.56 \u00b1 2.56) vs. placebo group (6.54 \u00b1 2.47) ( p  < 0.05). Response to treatment was seen in 64.3% of the treatment group vs. 47% in the placebo group ( p  = 0.18). Response to treatment was observed in 90.9% of patients with ulcerative colitis for more than 5 years compared with 44.4% of the control group ( p  = 0.01). CONCLUSION Regarding the effectiveness of pre-probiotics in mitigating symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis, it could be suggested to try pre-probiotics in the standard treatment particularly in those with more than five years ofthe disease.",

        "text": "Some Info on Probiotics for IBS\nSo I posted this in a comment and it was suggested that I make this info its own post. I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.\n\nFrom the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and/or severity: \n\nSaccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u00a0CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum\u00a0MIMBb75.\n\nI may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).\n\nAlso, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.\n\nBifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).\n\nA lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.\n\nIt's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.\n\nAlso, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.\n\nAnd of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor. This is just an info dump in case anyone wanted to know this stuff.\n\nHere are the links:\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00434-X/fulltext\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1590865819309594\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7279071/\n\nhttps://www.optibacprobiotics.com/learning-lab/in-depth/gut-health/which-probiotics-are-best-for-ibs#IBS-U\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00332/full#B68\n\nhttps://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/probiotics-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3296087/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33745570/\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eci.13201",

Given the potential for viloxazine ER to be coadministered with other pharmacotherapies, this trial investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of combination viloxazine ER\u2009+\u2009methylphenidate versus viloxazine ER or methylphenidate alone.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this single-center, crossover, open-label trial, healthy adult participants received oral administration of 700\u00a0mg viloxazine ER alone, 36\u00a0mg methylphenidate alone, and combination viloxazine ER (700\u00a0mg)\u2009+\u2009methylphenidate (36\u00a0mg), with blood samples collected over 4\u00a0days post-administration. The active drug in viloxazine ER (viloxazine) and methylphenidate was measured using chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, echocardiograms, and clinical laboratory evaluations.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 36 healthy adults who were enrolled, 34 completed the trial. The geometric least squares mean ratios are reported as [combination/single drug (90% confidence intervals)]. For viloxazine ER, maximum measured plasma concentration (C max )\u2009=\u2009100.98% (96.21-105.99), area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable time (AUC t )\u2009=\u200998.62% (96.21-101.08), and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC \u221e )\u2009=\u200998.96% (96.55-101.44).

Tolcapone withdrawal caused a transient elevation in COMT activity by 64% in patients receiving 100 mg three times daily and by 128% in those receiving 200 mg three times daily at approximately 1-2 weeks after discontinuation of drug. Thereafter, COMT activity was declining but did not reach baseline values by the 12-week study endpoint. However, this had no effect on plasma levodopa and 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) concentrations or on levodopa requirements. During treatment, tolcapone increased \"on\" time and decreased \"off\" time; after discontinuation of study medication and levodopa dose adjustment, on and off times were similar to baseline. Withdrawal was generally well tolerated; no patients withdrew from the trial during the posttreatment period, and no serious adverse events were observed. In conclusion, the transient increase in erythrocyte COMT activity observed after discontinuation oftolcapone is not associated with changes in peripheral levodopa metabolism and therefore has no significant clinical consequences in terms of levodopa requirements, clinical symptoms, or adverse events.",

Additionally, patient-, disorder- and treatment-related factors associated with adherence and persistence will be identified.\nMETHOD\n\n\nPost-hoc analysis of the active treatment group of a placebo-controlled, randomised, 24 week trial with MPH-ER with univariate description and multiple logistic regression models and Hosmer and Lemeshow tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn the sample of 241 adults with ADHD (mean age of 35.2 \u00b1 10.1 years), 9.4% of the patients were non-adherent, taking less than 80% of the dispensed medication. Factors associated with non-adherence included age<25 years, education level lower than secondary education, lacking family history of ADHD, lower ADHD baseline severity and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Lacking family history of ADHD, lower education level and lower self-rated medication efficacy, predicted non-adherence with a prediction accuracy of 16%. Seventeen percent of the patients discontinued early with most discontinuing within the first five weeks of the MPH-ER titration phase. Mean persistence in the discontinuing group was 63.4 \u00b1 49.4 days. Factors associated with discontinuation included male gender, lower education level, lacking family history of ADHD and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy. Treatment non-response, male gender and lower education level predicted treatment discontinuation with a prediction accuracy of 22.7%.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nMale adults without relatives with ADHD, with lower educational level and lower self- and observer-rated medication efficacy, who are newly treated with MPH-ER, are at increased risk of non-adherence and treatment discontinuation.

As nonstimulant treatments are often used after stimulants in ADHD, GXR was assessed relative to prior stimulant treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which ATX was included as a reference arm, and in the open-label phase of a randomized-withdrawal study (RWS). Participants were 6-17 years old with ADHD Rating Scale version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) scores \u226532 and Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scores \u22654. RCT participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg/day), ATX (10-100 mg/day), or placebo for 10-13 weeks. RWS participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg/day) for 13 weeks. Participants' last stimulant medication prior to enrolment, and reasons for stopping this medication, were collected at baseline. Change from baseline ADHD-RS-IV score and the proportion of responders were assessed by prior stimulant exposure. Of 163 RCT and 296 RWS participants who had previously received stimulant treatment, 142 and 224, respectively, had received methylphenidate (MPH); due to the low number of participants and the heterogeneity of non-MPH treatments, we only report data for prior MPH treatment. The most frequent reasons for stopping MPH were lack of effectiveness or side effects. Placebo-adjusted ADHD-RS-IV changes from baseline were significant in participants receiving GXR (prior MPH, -9.8, P<0.001, effect size [ES] 0.85; stimulant-na\u00efve, -7.6, P<0.001, ES 0.65). In ATX-treated participants, significant placebo-adjusted differences were seen in stimulant-na\u00efve (-5.0, P=0.022, ES 0.43) but not prior MPH-treated (-1.8, P>0.05, ES 0.15) participants. More participants met responder criteria with GXR versus placebo, regardless of prior treatment. GXR response was unaffected by prior stimulant treatment; ATX produced improvement only in stimulant-na\u00efve participants relative to placebo. These findings may be relevant to clinical decision-making regarding sequencing of ADHD treatments.",

This investigation may bear special importance for an adolescent (as opposed to child) population, because hormonal and metabolism differences between sexes are most likely to emerge at this time. Male (n = 19) and female (n = 16) adolescents, ages 16-19 with ADHD, participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study evaluating the effectiveness of osmotic-release methylphenidate, extended release amphetamine salts, placebo, and routine limited medication regimen. Medication efficacy was evaluated using ADHD symptom ratings from adolescent self-report and parent report, along with objective measures of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity during driving performance and neuropsychological tasks. Males and females were largely equivalent in impairment, and medication was similarly effective in reducing symptoms. No interactions were found between sex and medication on any measure of effectiveness or side effects. This finding suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release stimulant medications is equivalent for male and female adolescents with ADHD.",

Children were switched to placebo under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed by using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by parents and clinician.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction). There was no evidence of tic exacerbation in the evening as a rebound effect. Treatment with the maintenance dose was also associated with behavioral improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors, indicating continued efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAbrupt withdrawal of stimulant medication in children receiving long-term maintenance therapy does not appear to result in worsening of tic frequency or severity.

        "a8_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nWithin a single depressive episode, most patients receive different antidepressants because of an inadequate response to the first-line antidepressant. A commonly used strategy is to switch from a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. However, little is known about the tolerability of this switch with consideration of dose and drug concentration in blood.\nMETHODS\n\n\nAfter 4 weeks of inadequate response to escitalopram (10-20 mg/d), medication was switched to another 4 weeks of venlafaxine (VF, 150-375 mg/d) in 234 depressed patients. Serum concentrations, depression severity, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed weekly.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe switch of medication led to an increase of ADRs such as reduced salivation (+11%), orthostatic dizziness (+11%), and sweating (+9.8%). The most frequent ADRs during treatment with VF were reduced salivation (28.6%), sweating (24.6%), and orthostatic dizziness (15.8%). In patients receiving high-dose VF, a significant improvement of depressive symptomatology was observed, and most ADRs decreased during the course of treatment, even in patients above the therapeutic reference range.\nLIMITATIONS\n\n\nPatients and physicians were aware of medication, and there was no direct comparison with the herein presented switch of medication.\nIMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis study provides important information about the tolerability of a commonly used antidepressant treatment strategy. More detailed information about putative ADRs may help clinicians increase compliance through effective patient education. Because ADRs of VF were associated with the plasma concentration, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide the therapy and manage problems of tolerability.",
