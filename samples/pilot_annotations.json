Data were drawn from the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) study including FEP individuals\u00a0receiving treatment at sites randomized to provide either EIS (NAVIGATE) or community care (CC). Cannabis use was assessed monthly and symptom and functioning data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24\u00a0months. Among the 404 participants enrolled, 334 were classified into four cannabis use groups (consistent, sporadic, stopped, and never users) based on their use during the first year. Consistent and sporadic cannabis users were younger, whereas those who had stopped using were older. Sporadic users had the highest depression and the lowest functioning at baseline and improved less during treatment in negative emotions and intrapsychic foundations (e.g., motivation and sense of purpose) than non-users. However, sporadic users who received NAVIGATE improved more in overall symptoms and functioning than those who received CC. Consistent users did not tend to differ in their trajectories from non-users. Individuals with FEP who use cannabis sporadically showed less clinical improvement than non-users. However, EIS treatment reduced the negative effects of sporadic cannabis use on clinical outcomes. Those who use cannabis sporadically may have unique needs that require attention in EIS.",

Twenty-four subjects (12 occasional cannabis users and 12 heavy cannabis users) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way mixed model design. Both groups received single doses of THC placebo and 500 microg/kg THC by smoking. Performance tests were conducted at regular intervals between 0 and 8 h after smoking, and included measures of perceptual motor control (critical tracking task), dual task processing (divided attention task), motor inhibition (stop signal task) and cognition (Tower of London). THC significantly impaired performance of occasional cannabis users on critical tracking, divided attention and the stop signal task. THC did not affect the performance of heavy cannabis users except in the stop signal task, i.e. stop reaction time increased, particularly at high THC concentrations. Group comparisons of overall performance in occasional and heavy users did not reveal any persistent performance differences due to residual THC in heavy users.

Participants completed a baseline and an experimental mobile laboratory assessment that included 3 points: before, immediately after, and 1 hour after ad libitum legal market flower and concentrate use. Of the 133 individuals enrolled and assessed, 55 regular flower cannabis users (41.4%) and 66 regular concentrate cannabis users (49.6%) complied with the study's cannabis use instructions and had complete data across primary outcomes.\nExposures\n\n\nFlower users were randomly assigned to use either 16% or 24% THC flower and concentrate users were randomly assigned to use either 70% or 90% THC concentrate that they purchased from a dispensary.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\n\nPrimary outcome measures included plasma cannabinoids, subjective drug intoxication, and neurobehavioral tasks testing attention, memory, inhibitory control, and balance.\nResults\n\n\nA total of 121 participants completed the study for analysis: 55 flower users (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [8.1] years; 25 women [46%]) and 66 concentrate users (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [10.4] years; 30 women [45%]). Concentrate users compared with flower users exhibited higher plasma THC levels and 11-hydroxy\u03949-THC (THC's active metabolite) across all points. After ad libitum cannabis administration, mean plasma THC levels were 0.32 (SE\u2009=\u20090.43) \u03bcg/mL in concentrate users (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 3.18) and 0.14 (SE\u2009=\u20090.16) \u03bcg/mL in flower users. Most neurobehavioral measures were not altered by short-term cannabis consumption. However, delayed verbal memory (F1,203\u2009=\u200932.31; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and balance function (F1,203\u2009=\u200918.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001) were impaired after use. Differing outcomes for the type of product (flower vs concentrate) or potency within products were not observed.\nConclusions and Relevance\n\n\nThis study provides information about the association of pharmacological and neurobehavioral outcomes with legal market cannabis. Short-term use of concentrates was associated with higher levels of THC exposure. Across forms of cannabis and potencies, users' domains of verbal memory and proprioception-focused postural stability were primarily associated with THC administration.",

Youth reported subjective \"high\" while smoking, stimulation, sedation, stress, craving, and grams of marijuana used in the natural environment via wireless electronic devices. Bayesian multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) evaluated mediation via indirect effect tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSignificant within (daily) and between (person) variability and distinctive within and between effects supported the MSEM approach. Subjective high while smoking was significantly reduced for youth in the topiramate condition, relative to placebo, and the indirect effect of reduced subjective high on total grams of cannabis smoked that day was significant. Indirect effects through other subjective responses were not significant.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe results of this initial study suggest that altering subjective responses to smoking, specifically subjective high, may be a key target for developing adjunctive pharmacotherapies for cannabis misuse. More generally, this work provides an example for applying ecological momentary assessment and analytic techniques to evaluate mechanisms of behavior change in longitudinal data.",

N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1888-1897.\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nCannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2-55 years) who had had 2 or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg/kg (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in 2 equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percentage reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group ( P = .005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group, and P = .002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAmong children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/d to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560.)

Epilepsia. 2018;59(8):1540-1548.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nSince 2014, cannabidiol (CBD) has been administered to patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies (TREs) in an ongoing expanded access program (EAP). We report interim results on the safety and efficacy of CBD in EAP patients treated through December 2016.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTwenty-five US-based EAP sites enrolling patients with TRE taking stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included. During the 4-week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure types. Patients received oral CBD starting at 2 to 10 mg/kg/d, titrated to a maximum dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/d. Patient visits were every 2 to 4 weeks through 16 weeks and every 2 to 12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy end points included the percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive and total seizure frequency and percentage of patients with \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reductions in seizures versus baseline. Data were analyzed descriptively for the efficacy analysis set and using the last-observation-carried-forward method to account for missing data. Adverse events (AEs) were documented at each visit.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 607 patients in the safety data set, 146 (24%) withdrew; the most common reasons were lack of efficacy (89 [15%]) and AEs (32 [5%]). Mean age was 13 years (range, 0.4-62). Median number of concomitant AEDs was 3 (range, 0-10). Median CBD dose was 25 mg/kg/d; median treatment duration was 48 weeks. Add-on CBD reduced median monthly convulsive seizures by 51% and total seizures by 48% at 12 weeks; reductions were similar through 96 weeks. Proportion of patients with \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reductions in convulsive seizures were 52%, 31%, and 11%, respectively, at 12 weeks, with similar rates through 96 weeks. Cannabidiol was generally well tolerated; most common AEs were diarrhea (29%) and somnolence (22%).\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nResults from this ongoing EAP support previous observational and clinical trial data, showing that add-on CBD may be an efficacious long-term treatment option for TRE.

Neurology. 2018;90(14):e1204-e1211.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate the safety and preliminary pharmacokinetics of a pharmaceutical formulation of purified cannabidiol (CBD) in children with Dravet syndrome.\nMETHODS\n\n\nPatients aged 4 to 10 years were randomized 4:1 to CBD (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d) or placebo taken twice daily. The double-blind trial comprised 4-week baseline, 3-week treatment (including titration), 10-day taper, and 4-week follow-up periods. Completers could continue in an open-label extension. Multiple pharmacokinetic blood samples were taken on the first day of dosing and at end of treatment for measurement of CBD, its metabolites 6-OH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and 7-COOH-CBD, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; clobazam and metabolite N-desmethylclobazam [N-CLB], valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, and stiripentol). Safety assessments were clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse events (AEs), seizure frequency, and suicidality.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThirty-four patients were randomized (10, 8, and 9 to the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d CBD groups and 7 to placebo); 32 (94%) completed treatment. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites was dose proportional (AUC 0-t ). Cannabidiol did not affect concomitant AED levels, apart from an increase in N-CLB (except in patients taking stiripentol). The most common AEs on CBD were pyrexia, somnolence, decreased appetite, sedation, vomiting, ataxia, and abnormal behavior. Six patients taking CBD and valproate developed elevated transaminases; none met criteria for drug-induced liver injury and all recovered. No other clinically relevant safety signals were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nExposure to CBD and its metabolites increased proportionally with dose. An interaction with N-CLB was observed, likely related to CBD inhibition of cytochrome P450 subtype 2C19. Cannabidiol resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE\n\n\nThis study provides class I evidence that for children with Dravet syndrome, CBD resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated.",

We compared the neural response to \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in healthy volunteers in whom the drug did or did not induce acute psychotic symptoms. Method In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pseudorandomized design, 21 healthy men with minimal experience of cannabis were given either 10\u00a0mg THC or placebo, orally. Behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures were then recorded whilst they performed a go/no-go task.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe sample was subdivided on the basis of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive score following administration of THC into transiently psychotic (TP; n\u00a0=\u00a011) and non-psychotic (NP; n\u00a0=\u00a010) groups. During the THC condition, TP subjects made more frequent inhibition errors than the NP group and showed differential activation relative to the NP group in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left and right middle temporal gyri and in the right cerebellum. In these regions, THC had opposite effects on activation relative to placebo in the two groups. The TP group also showed less activation than the NP group in the right middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum, independent of the effects of THC.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn this first demonstration of inter-subject variability in sensitivity to the psychotogenic effects of THC, we found that the presence of acute psychotic symptoms was associated with a differential effect of THC on activation in the ventral and medial temporal cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that these regions mediate the effects of the drug on psychotic symptoms.",

In the present study, we examined the role of the endocannabinoid system in executive function, focusing on both the associated brain network and the default mode network. A pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted with a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, investigating effects of the endocannabinoid agonist \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on executive function in 20 healthy volunteers, using a continuous performance task with identical pairs. Task performance was impaired after THC administration, reflected in both an increase in false alarms and a reduction in detected targets. This was associated with reduced deactivation in a set of brain regions linked to the default mode network, including posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. Less deactivation was significantly correlated with lower performance after THC. Regions that were activated by the continuous performance task, notably bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex, did not show effects of THC.

We investigated the effects of acute oral administration of 10mg of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on inhibitory control and regional brain activation during inhibitory processing in humans and examined whether these effects are related to the induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence using a repeated-measures, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design. We studied thirty-six healthy, English-speaking, right-handed men with minimal previous exposure to cannabis and other illicit drugs twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they performed a response inhibition (Go/No-Go) task. Relative to placebo, delta-9-THC caused transient psychotic symptoms, anxiety, intoxication and sedation, inhibition errors and impaired inhibition efficiency. Severity of psychotic symptoms was directly correlated with inhibition error frequency and inversely with inhibition efficiency under the influence of delta-9-THC. Delta-9-THC attenuated left inferior frontal activation which was inversely correlated with the frequency of inhibition errors and severity of psychotic symptoms and positively with inhibition efficiency under its influence. These results provide experimental evidence that impairments in cognitive processes involved in the inhibitory control of thoughts and actions and inferior frontal function under the influence of cannabis may have a role in the emergence of transient psychotic symptoms under its influence.",

Interaction terms were fitted in survival models to estimate the risk of both outcomes across levels of an overall microvascular disease score (range 0 to 100) and its individual components: diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.\nRESULTS\n\n\nDuring a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 1685 primary outcomes and 1806 deaths occurred in 9405 participants. The outcome-specific microvascular score was \u226430 in 97.9% of subjects for the primary outcome and in 98.5% for death. For participants with scores of 0 and 30, respectively, the 10-year absolute risk difference between intensive glucose control and standard treatment ranged from\u00a0-0.8% (95% CI,\u00a0-2.6, 1.1) to\u00a0-3.0%\u00a0-7.1, 1.1) for the primary outcome and from\u00a0-0.5% (-2.1, 1.1) to 0.7% (-4.2, 5.6) for mortality.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between fibrin clot properties and clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Plasma samples were collected at hospital discharge from 974 ACS patients with diabetes randomised to clopidogrel or ticagrelor in the PLATO trial. A validated turbidimetric assay was employed to study fibrin clot lysis and maximum turbidity. One-year rates of cardiovascular (CV) death, spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) and PLATO-defined major bleeding events were assessed after sample collection. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined using Cox proportional analysis. After adjusting for CV risk factors, each 50% increase in lysis time was associated with increased risk of CV death/MI (HR 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.44;  p \u2009=\u20090.026) and CV death alone (HR 1.38; 1.08-1.76;  p \u2009=\u20090.01). Similarly, each 50% increase in maximum turbidity was associated with increased risk of CV death/MI (HR 1.25; 1.02-1.53;  p \u2009=\u20090.031) and CV death alone (HR 1.49; 1.08-2.04;  p \u2009=\u20090.014).

The follow-up ended on Sept 30, 2007. Baseline and updated 9-year mean values of potential confounders were tested in Cox models to adjust hazard ratios (HRs). UKPDS is registered at the ISRCTN registry, 75451837.\nFINDINGS\n\n\nAmong the 5028 participants included, 564 had latent autoimmune diabetes and 4464 had type 2 diabetes. After median 17\u00b73 years (IQR 12\u00b76-20\u00b77) of follow-up, the composite microvascular outcome occurred in 1041 (21%) participants. The incidence for the composite microvascular outcome was 15\u00b78 (95% CI 13\u00b74-18\u00b77) per 1000 person-years in latent autoimmune diabetes and 14\u00b72 (13\u00b73-15\u00b72) per 1000 person-years in type 2 diabetes. Adults with latent autoimmune diabetes had a lower risk of the composite outcome during the first 9 years of follow-up than those with type 2 diabetes (adjusted HR 0\u00b745 [95% CI 0\u00b730-0\u00b768], p<0\u00b70001), whereas in subsequent years their risk was higher than for those with type 2 diabetes (1\u00b725 [1\u00b701-1\u00b754], p=0\u00b7047). Correcting for the higher updated 9-year mean HbA 1c  seen in adults with latent autoimmune diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes explained entirely their subsequent increased risk for the composite microvascular outcome (adjusted HR 0\u00b799 [95% CI 0\u00b780-1\u00b723], p=0\u00b793).\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nAt diabetes onset, adults with latent autoimmune diabetes have a lower risk of microvascular complications followed by a later higher risk of complications than do adults with type 2 diabetes, secondary to worse glycaemic control. Implementing strict glycaemic control from the time of diagnosis could reduce the later risk of microvascular complications in adults with latent autoimmune diabetes.\nFUNDING\n\n\nEuropean Foundation for the Study of Diabetes Mentorship Programme (AstraZeneca).",

        "a7_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nEmerging data and case reports have found coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis as sequelae of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Case reports have reported thrombotic complications caused by COVID-19-related coagulopathy leading to limb loss. Alarmingly, many of these patients had no underlying vascular disease prior to being infected with COVID-19. Many of these case reports discuss patients developing gangrene in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our study compares the incidence of gangrene in the ICU in COVID-19 patients to baseline inpatient levels prior to the pandemic.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis retrospective analysis investigates two subsets of patients from a single institution. The first was from 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic; the second subset was from 2019 before the pandemic. Demographic data and medication history were ascertained for both groups. Primary outcomes measures included extremity gangrene that developed in the ICU, mortality, and major amputation.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were 249 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the ICU in 2020. In 2019, 1,846 admissions to the ICU took place, of which 249 patients were randomized to chart review. There were 13 cases of gangrene that developed in the ICU, 12 of which took place in 2020. In-hospital mortality was 11.6% in nonCOVID-19 patients in 2019 vs. 41.4% in 2021 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Only 16.7% of the COVID-19 gangrene patients had previously known arterial disease. Also, patients in the COVID-19 group with gangrene were four times more likely to be smokers (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). When the data were stratified to compare between gangrene development and no gangrene development, the combined total gangrene group had longer hospital stays, higher need for blood transfusions, required major amputations, and revascularization. A multivariate logistic regression from the total study similarly demonstrated that COVID-19 infection is associated with an 18.23 times increased risk of gangrene.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCOVID-19 has resulted in an incomprehensible societal impact that will linger\u00a0for years to come. The last 2\u00a0years have reinforced that COVID-19 will be a part of our clinical practice indefinitely. This study emphasizes the importance of clinician awareness of COVID-19 induced critical limb ischemia in those without underlying arterial disease\u00a0and\u00a0few medical comorbidities. More research efforts toward preventing limb loss and COVID-19 coagulopathy must be performed expeditiously to achieve a better understanding.",

        "a8_doc": "A common factor contributing to organ damage in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is impaired tissue blood flow caused by damage to vascular endothelial cells (VECs). Damage can occur even before the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. It can be caused by both a high average blood glucose concentration and/or large daily spikes in blood glucose. While much of the present literature focuses on the damage to VECs and organs from these large glucose excursions, this review will focus on the consequence of this damage, that is, how endothelial cell damage in diabetes affects normal daily activities (e.g., exercise, reaction to typical stimuli) and various treatment modalities (e.g.. contrast baths and electrical stimulation therapy). It is important to understand the effects of VEC damage such as poor skin blood flow, compromised thermoregulation, and altered response to skin pressure in designing diabetes technologies as simple as heating pads and as complex as continuous glucose monitors. At the simplest level, people with diabetes have poor circulation to the skin and other organs. In the skin, even the blood flow response to locally applied pressure, such as during standing, is different than for people who do not have T2DM. Simple weight bearing on the foot can occlude the skin circulation. This makes the skin more susceptible to damage. In addition, endothelial damage has far-reaching effects on the whole body during normal activities of daily living, including an impaired response to local heat, such as hot packs and contrast baths, and higher body temperatures during whole body heating due to impaired blood flow and a reduced ability to sweat. Finally, because of multiple organ damage, people with T2DM have poor balance and gait and impaired exercise performance.",

The participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated Feb 7, 2020). We ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care). Among people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, diabetes status was ascertained by linkage to the national diabetes register, Scottish Care Information Diabetes. We compared the cumulative incidence of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes using logistic regression. For people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases. We tested the association of these factors with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes, and constructed a prediction model using stepwise regression and 20-fold cross-validation.\nFINDINGS\n\n\nOf the total Scottish population on March 1, 2020 (n=5\u2008463\u2008300), the population with diabetes was 319\u2008349 (5\u00b78%), 1082 (0\u00b73%) of whom developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 by July 31, 2020, of whom 972 (89\u00b78%) were aged 60 years or older. In the population without diabetes, 4081 (0\u00b71%) of 5\u2008143\u2008951 people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19. As of July 31, the overall odds ratio (OR) for diabetes, adjusted for age and sex, was 1\u00b7395 (95% CI 1\u00b7304-1\u00b7494; p<0\u00b70001, compared with the risk in those without diabetes. The OR was 2\u00b7396 (1\u00b7815-3\u00b7163; p<0\u00b70001) in type 1 diabetes and 1\u00b7369 (1\u00b7276-1\u00b7468; p<0\u00b70001) in type 2 diabetes. Among people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal function, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p<0\u00b70001), and have been a smoker (p=0\u00b70011). The cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes had a C-statistic of 0\u00b785 (0\u00b783-0\u00b786).\nINTERPRETATION\n\n\nOverall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population. The risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history.\nFUNDING\n\n\nNone.",

        "a10_doc": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\nCOVID-19 causes a considerable degradation of pulmonary function to the point of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Over the course of the disease the gas exchange capability of the lung can get impaired to such an extent that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is needed as a life-saving intervention. In patients COVID-19 as well as ECMO may cause severe coagulopathies which manifest themselves in micro and macro thrombosis. Previous studies established D-dimers as a marker for critical thrombosis of the ECMO system while on admission increased D-dimers are associated with a higher mortality in COIVD-19 patients. It is therefore crucial to determine if COVID-19 poses an increased risk of early thrombosis of the vital ECMO system.\nMETHODS\n\n\n40 patients who required ECMO support were enrolled in a retrospective analysis and assigned into 2 groups. The COVID group consist of 20 COVID-19 patients who required ECMO support (n\u200a=\u200a20), whereas 20 ECMO patients without COVID-19 were assigned to the control group. D-dimers, fibrinogen, antithrombin III (AT III), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and platelet count were analysed using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing and MANOVAs.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe analysis of both groups shows highly significant differences in the dynamics of hemostasis. The increase in D-dimers that is associated with thrombosis of the ECMO systems occurs in COVID-19 patients around 2 days earlier (p\u200a=\u200a2,8115 10-11) while fibrinogen is consumed steadily. In the control group fibrinogen levels increase rapidly after ten days with a plateau phase of around five days (p\u200a=\u200a1,407 10-3)\u00a0. Both groups experience a rapid increase in AT III after start of support by ECMO (p\u200a=\u200a5,96 10-15). In the COVID group platelet count decreased from 210 giga/l to 130 giga/l within eight days, while in the same time span in the control group platelets decreased from 180 giga/l to 105 giga/l (p\u200a=\u200a1,1 10-15). In both groups a marked increase in LDH beyond 5000 U/l occurs (p\u200a=\u200a3,0865 10-15).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe early increase in D-dimers and decrease in fibrinogen suggests that COVID-19 patients bear an increased risk of early thrombosis of the ECMO system compared to other diseases treated with ECMO. Additionally, the control group shows signs of severe inflammation 10 days after the start of ECMO which were absent in COVID-19 patients.",

Additionally, to examine whether having insurance decrease the financial pressures of diabetes care.\nDESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS\n\n\nRacially/ethnically diverse patients (N\u2009=\u20091,361; 249 non-Hispanic whites, 194 Vietnamese, and 533 Mexican American) with type 2 diabetes were recruited from seven outpatient clinics for a cross-sectional, observational study.\nKEY RESULTS\n\n\nAlthough both Vietnamese and Mexican-American patients reported having low annual incomes, more Mexican Americans reported the presence of financial barriers to getting medical care and perceived financial burden due to their diabetes, compared to whites and Vietnamese (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Over half (53.2%) of Mexican Americans reported cost-related non-adherence compared to 27.2% of white and 27.6% of Vietnamese patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Perceived financial burden was found to be associated with poor glucose control (HbA1c \u22658%), after adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics (aOR\u2009=\u20091.70, 95%CI 1.09-2.63), but not when adjusting for non-adherence. Similarly, a significant association between presence of financial barriers and HbA1c (aOR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95%CI 1.23-2.32) was attenuated with the inclusion of insurance status in the model. Being uninsured (aOR\u2009=\u20091.90, 95%CI 1.13-3.21) and non-adherent (aOR\u2009=\u20091.49, 95%CI 1.06-2.08) were each independently associated with HbA1c.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWhile having health insurance coverage eliminated some of the financial barriers associated with having diabetes, low-income patients still faced significant financial burdens. Thus, providing health insurance to more individuals is only the first step towards eliminating health disparities. It is important to address medication cost in order to improve medication adherence and glucose control.",

Although there is an abundance of literature concerning the medical management of diabetes, few studies have assessed the financial impact of its treatment. This study examined the savings in prescription costs associated with a weight reduction program for obese men and women with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\n\n\nForty subjects ages 40-70 years who had body mass indexes of 30-40 kg/m2 and NIDDM of more than 1 year duration were assigned to one of two 800-kcal weight-loss programs for 12 weeks. A cost analysis was done on the 32 subjects who were taking anti-hypertensive and/or anti-diabetes medications. A list of medications and monthly amounts was obtained at the start, upon completion, and 1 year following completion of the diet. The average out-of-pocket cost for a month's supply of each prescription was calculated by polling 16 retail pharmacies in Lexington, Kentucky.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSubjects lost an average of 15.3 kg (33.7 lb) over the 12 weeks. At 1-year follow-up, subjects maintained a mean 9.0-kg (19.8 lb) weight loss. The average monthly prediet out-of-pocket cost for anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetes medications and supplies was $63.30 per subject. Following completion of the diet, this cost per month decreased to $20.40 and at 1-year follow-up the average monthly cost per subject was $32.40. The estimated average savings in prescription costs per subject over the year was $442.80.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nSignificant short- and long-term savings in prescription costs were obtained following a 12-week hypocaloric weight reduction program for obese individuals with NIDDM.",

Little is known about preferences and frequency of physician-patient discussions about cost/affordability among individuals managing respiratory conditions.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo examine who has a preference to discuss the cost of their asthma care with their physician, how often physician-patient communication about cost/affordability actually is occurring, and what clinical and demographic characteristics of patients are predictive of communication.\nMETHODS\n\n\nData came from 422 African American adult women with asthma who were asked about communication preferences and practices around cost and affordability with their physician. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple variable logistic regression models.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\n\n\nFifty-two percent (n\u2009=\u2009219) of this sample perceived financial burden. Seventy-two percent (n\u2009=\u2009300) reported a preference to discuss cost with their health-care provider. Thirty-nine percent (n\u2009=\u2009163) reported actually having a conversation with their physician about cost. Among the 61% who reported no discussion, 40% (n\u2009=\u2009103) reported financial burden, and 55% (n\u2009=\u2009140) reported a preference for discussion. Lower household income (P\u2009<\u20090.001), perception of financial burden (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher out-of-pocket expenses for medicines (P\u2009<\u20090.05) were significantly predictive of greater preference to communicate about cost/affordability with the doctor when adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. Perception of financial burden (P\u2009<\u20090.001), preference to discuss affordability (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and greater number of chronic conditions (P\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly predictive of greater likelihood of communication about cost/affordability with the doctor when adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. Bivariate analyses revealed that patients who reported a discussion of cost were more likely to report worse asthma control and lower asthma-related quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAn imbalance is evident between patients who would like to discuss cost with their doctor and those who actually do. Patients are interested in low-cost options and a venue for addressing their concerns with a care provider; therefore, a greater understanding is needed in how to effectively and efficiently integrate these conversations and viable solutions into the delivery of health care.

        "a10_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nGiven the complexity of the health insurance market in the United States and the confusion that often stems from these complexities, patient perception about the value of health insurance in managing chronic disease is important to understand.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo examine differences between public and private health insurance in perceptions of financial burden with managing asthma, outcomes, and factors that explain these perceptions.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSecondary analysis was performed using baseline data from a randomized clinical trial that were collected through telephone interviews with 219 African American women seeking services for asthma and reporting perceptions of financial burden with asthma management. Path analysis with multigroup models and multiple variable regression analyses were used to examine associations.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFor public (P < .001) and private (P < .01) coverage, being married and more educated were indirectly associated with greater perceptions of financial burden through different explanatory pathways. When adjusted for multiple morbidities, asthma control, income, and out-of-pocket expenses, those with private insurance used fewer inpatient (P < .05) and emergency department (P < .001) services compared with those with public insurance. When also adjusted for health insurance, greater financial burden was associated with more urgent office visits (P < .001) and lower quality of life (P < .001).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAfrican American women who perceive asthma as a financial burden regardless of health insurance report more urgent health care visits and lower quality of life. Burden may be present despite having and being able to generate economic resources and health insurance. Further policy efforts are indicated and special attention should focus on type of coverage.",

I know when I had coverage with my job i had a ppo plan. he's the one that chooses the plans at his job so im not the best when it comes to explaining the details for it.. \nwas orginally taking metformin but it's horrible and over the past 2 months it's been making me sick as a dog so I asked my endocrinologist can I go on something else. she recommended ozempic since alot of patients responded well to it, lost weight, and had a good effect on their sugar. plus it's taken only weekly in which sounds great for someone like me since I'm not the best with keeping up with medications. back in December since we had hit our 6k deductible I had paid nothing  when I recieced the medication so I had no clue what the actual price would be but I nearly had a heart attack when I tried picking it up in the store recently...with my plan I'm at 800 bucks for the thing and optum informed me it's 2300 (1981 with the discount card) for a 90 day supply. that's ALOT  of money...I was going to purchase farxiga today with optum (1500 dollars) but literally don't have the money to afford to do so..my car needs a new catalytic converter so finacially I had to make the cut to my medication (my cardiologist put me on that to prevent heart failure since I have \"resistant hypertension\" that's not responding well medication)\n\ni made a joke to my husband and said I may have to divorce him just so I qualify for that government health insurance. hell looking at it now I may be serious! as a diabetic or anyone in America on any type of medication  how are ppl able to afford their insulin/pills/machines/ whatever. our household income is around 85k so there's not much assistance we can get that im aware of",

At baseline, 0.5, 1.5, 4, 6, and 10 years, sleep disorders and hallucinations were assessed by standardized scales with the longitudinal data analyzed by generalized estimating equations with assumptions of linearity in time.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt 10 years, we could account for all subjects (27 interviewed, 61 deceased, and 1 too ill for interview). Hallucination prevalence and severity increased over time (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0001). Acting out dreams also increased over time (p = 0.001). In contrast, presence of vivid dreams/nightmares or sleep fragmentation did not increase over time. For all visits, the prevalence of sleep fragmentation did not differ between subjects with vs without hallucinations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, p = 0.09). However, severe sleep fragmentation was associated with concurrent hallucinations (OR 2.01, p = 0.006). The presence of hallucinations was also highly associated with concurrent vivid dreams/nightmares (OR = 2.60, p < 0.0001) and with concurrent acting out dreams (OR = 2.38, p = 0.0004). Among the baseline nonhallucinators, no sleep abnormalities at study entry predicted future development of hallucinations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nHallucinations and sleep abnormalities follow very different patterns of progression in PD over 10 years. Whereas patients with hallucinations often have concurrent sleep aberrations, no sleep problem is predictive of future hallucinations.",

        "a2_doc": "Idiopathic hypersomnia continues to evolve from the concept of \"sleep drunkenness\" introduced by Bedrich Roth in Prague in 1956 and the description of idiopathic hypersomnia with two forms, polysymptomatic and monosymptomatic, by the same Bedrich Roth in 1976. The diagnostic criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia have varied with the successive revisions of the International classifications of sleep disorders, including the recent 3rd edition. No epidemiological studies have been conducted so far. Disease onset occurs most often during adolescence or young adulthood. A familial background is often present but rigorous studies are still lacking. The key manifestation is hypersomnolence. It is often accompanied by sleep of long duration and debilitating sleep inertia. Polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is mandatory, as well as a 24\u00a0h\u00a0PSG or a 2-wk actigraphy in association with a sleep log to ensure a total 24-h\u00a0sleep time longer than or equal to 66O minutes, when the mean sleep latency on the MSLT is longer than 8\u00a0min. Yet, MSLT is neither sensitive nor specific and the polysomnographic diagnostic criteria require continuous readjustment and biologic markers are still lacking. Idiopathic hypersomnia is most often a chronic condition though spontaneous remission may occur. The condition is disabling, sometimes even more so than narcolepsy type 1 or 2. Based on neurochemical, genetic and immunological analyses as well as on exploration of the homeostatic and circadian processes of sleep, various pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed. Differential diagnosis involves a number of diseases and it is not yet clear whether idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy type 2 are not the same condition. Until now, the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia has mirrored that of the sleepiness of narcolepsy type 1 or 2. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil have just been published, as well as a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of clarithromycine, a negative allosteric modulator of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A receptor.",

        "a3_doc": "Exploding head syndrome is a sensory parasomnia characterized by the perception of loud noises and/or a sense of explosion in the head that occurs when transitioning to or from sleep. Despite receiving little attention from both researchers and clinicians, studies suggest that approximately 10%-15% of individuals have episodes, with significant levels of fear occurring in a subset of cases. Using two independent samples, we examine sleep and well-being variables associated with exploding head syndrome. We focused on insomnia symptoms, life stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, and sleep experiences such as sleep paralysis as potential factors associated with exploding head syndrome. Study 1 consisted of 199 female undergraduate students. We found a lifetime prevalence of 37.19%, with 6.54% experiencing at least one episode a month. All variables were associated with exploding head syndrome in univariate analyses, but only insomnia symptoms and sleep paralysis frequency were significantly associated with exploding head syndrome in multiple logistic regression models. Study 2 was an international sample of 1683 participants (age range 18-82, 53.00% female). Lifetime prevalence was 29.59%, with monthly episodes occurring in 3.89% of participants. The same set of variables was investigated as in Study 1, with dissociative experiences during wakefulness and a larger range of sleep experiences also included. Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1. In addition, dissociative experiences during wakefulness and other sleep experiences such as nightmares were associated with exploding head syndrome in multiple logistic regression models. These studies provide valuable first insights into variables associated with exploding head syndrome.Clinical trial information: Study 1 constitutes a planned exploratory outcome of a pilot feasibility study conducted to provide information useful for designing a clinical trial: Name: STOP-pilot.

There were also significantly fewer attacks of sleep paralysis, whilst the effects on nightmare and hypnogenic hallucinations were minor. The frequency of sleep attacks decreased slightly during femoxetine treatment, but the overall estimated sleep time during the day and excessive daytime sleepiness remained un-affected. An ambulatory sleep recording for 48 h one week after the start of the femoxetine and placebo period showed that femoxetine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the total time spent in REM sleep. The side-effects of femoxetine were restricted to transient nausea in 2 patients.

        "a5_doc": "STUDY OBJECTIVES\n\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel cognitive behavioral therapy for hypersomnia (CBT-H) in people with central disorders of hypersomnolence and co-occurring depressive symptoms using a telehealth model for delivery and assessment.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThirty-five adults with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia received a 6-session CBT-H delivered individually or in small groups using videoconferencing. The clinical impact of CBT-H was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and other patient-reported outcomes collected online at baseline and posttreatment. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and telehealth model was also evaluated using qualitative data collected from exit interviews conducted through videoconferencing.\nRESULTS\n\n\nForty percent of the sample achieved a clinically significant baseline to posttreatment change in depressive symptoms (decrease in Patient Health Questionnaire \u2265 5), which is below the prespecified efficacy benchmark (50% of the sample). The prespecified benchmark for a minimal clinically important difference (Cohen's d > 0.5) on other psychosocial measures was met only on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System global self-efficacy (d = 0.62) in the total sample. Qualitative data revealed enthusiasm for the accessibility of telehealth delivery and the usefulness of several cognitive and behavioral modules but also revealed opportunities to refine the CBT-H program.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThese findings indicate that this new CBT-H program can potentially reduce depressive symptoms and improve self-efficacy in people with central disorders of hypersomnolence. Furthermore, telehealth is a promising model for remote delivery and data collection to enhance participant accessibility and engagement.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nRegistry: ClinicalTrials.gov; Name: Psychosocial Adjunctive Treatment for Hypersomnia (PATH); URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03904238; Identifier: NCT03904238.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of OSA in IIH and evaluate the diagnostic performance of OSA screening tools in IIH. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between weight loss, OSA and IIH over 12\u00a0months.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA sub-study of a multi-centre, randomised controlled parallel group trial comparing the impact of bariatric surgery vs. community weight management intervention (CWI) on IIH-related outcomes over 12\u00a0months (IIH:WT). OSA was assessed using home-based polygraphy (ApneaLink Air, ResMed) at baseline and 12\u00a0months. OSA was defined as an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)\u2009\u2265\u200915 or\u2009\u2265\u20095 with excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale \u226511 ).\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf the 66 women in the IIH: WT trial, 46 were included in the OSA sub-study. OSA prevalence was 47% (n\u2009=\u200919). The STOP-BANG had the highest sensitivity (84%) compared to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (69%) and Berlin (68%) to detect OSA. Bariatric surgery resulted in greater reductions in AHI vs. CWI (median [95%CI] AHI reduction of \u2009-\u20092.8 [\u2009-\u200911.9, 0.7], p\u2009=\u20090.017). Over 12\u00a0months there was a positive association between changes in papilloedema and AHI (r\u2009=\u20090.543, p\u2009=\u20090.045), despite adjustment for changes in the body mass index (R 2 \u2009=\u20090.522, p\u2009=\u20090.017).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nOSA is common in IIH and the STOP-BANG questionnaire was the most sensitive screening tool. Bariatric surgery improved OSA in patients with IIH. The improvement in AHI was associated with improvement in papilloedema independent of weight loss. Whether OSA treatment has beneficial impact on papilloedema warrants further evaluation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\n\n\nIIH: WT is registered as ISRCTN40152829 and on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02124486 (28/04/2014).",

        "p7": "Furthermore, intranasal hcrt-1 had a clear REM sleep stabilising effect and led to significantly reduced direct wake to REM transitions.\n",
        "a7_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nThe neuropeptides hypocretin-1 and -2 (hcrt-1 and -2, also known as orexin A and B) are crucially involved in the regulation of sleep/wake states. On the one hand, the sleep-wake disorder narcolepsy can be caused by an hcrt-1 deficiency. On the other, intracerebral administration of hcrt-1 produces an increase in wakefulness at the expense of REM sleep in normal and narcoleptic animals. In humans intranasal administration has been shown to effectively deliver neuropeptides directly to the central nervous system. We hypothesised that the intranasal application of hcrt-1 increases wakefulness and reduces REM sleep in the natural human hcrt-1 deficiency narcolepsy with cataplexy.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this double-blind, random-order crossover, placebo-controlled, within-subject design study we administered human recombinant hcrt-1 (435 nmol) intranasally to eight subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy before night sleep, followed by standard polysomnography.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAlthough intranasal administration of hcrt-1 had no statistically significant effect on nocturnal wakefulness, we found that it reduced REM sleep quantity, particularly during the second half of the recording. Furthermore, intranasal hcrt-1 had a clear REM sleep stabilising effect and led to significantly reduced direct wake to REM transitions.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIn this pilot study we found, first, evidence that the intranasal administration of hcrt-1 has functional effects on sleep in narcolepsy with cataplexy. Our results may encourage the use of the intranasal approach in further studies on hypocretinergic sleep regulation and might also contribute to the future development of a causal treatment for narcolepsy with cataplexy.",

OSA-related data (Apnea Hypopnea Index, AHI; Oxygen Desaturation Index, ODI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and overall patient satisfaction was compared between these patient categories. Correlations between ISI scores and each of these variables were examined.\nResults\n\n\nOf the 132 patients, 26% had moderate/severe insomnia at follow-up assessment. ESS and FOSQ scores were worse in the insomnia group at baseline, follow-up, and in the change from baseline, but AHI and ODI scores did not differ between patients with and without insomnia. Frequency of overall satisfaction at follow-up was lower in the insomnia group (58.8% vs. 92.8% with no insomnia,  P \u00a0<\u2009.001). Patients with insomnia were more likely to have depression (56% vs. 27% without insomnia,  P \u00a0<\u2009.002).\nConclusions\n\n\nInsomnia is associated with worse patient-reported outcomes of daytime sleepiness and sleep-related quality of life in patients with OSA receiving HNS therapy. Depression is more prevalent in patients with comorbid insomnia. The ISI may help physicians to address comorbid insomnia and achieve high patient satisfaction and adherence to HNS therapy.\nLevel of Evidence\n\n\n4.",

        "a9_doc": "This study examined the relationship between deficits in color and contrast discrimination and visual hallucinations (VH) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal visual acuity. Thirty-five nondemented and nonpsychotic PD patients with normal visual acuity and without major ophthalmologic disease were interviewed twice and divided into two groups: hallucinators (n = 14) and non-hallucinating controls (n = 21). The groups were compared for color vision (assessed by Lanthony D-15 [LD] and Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue [FM] tests), and for contrast sensitivity (tested by Vis tech tables [VT] and monocular and binocular Pelli-Robson test [PR]). There was no difference in age, duration or stage of PD, or dosage or duration of levodopa therapy between the two groups. Parkinson's disease patients showed impairment on all visual tests, with the hallucinators performing worse than the controls on all tests. This difference was significant for the LD (p < 0.007), the VT at 1.5 and 3 cycles per degree (p < 0.037 and 0.043, respectively) and the monocular PR tests (p < 0.049). The results led the authors to conclude that in patients with normal visual acuity, those with VH show added visual deficits of color and contrast discrimination. These ophthalmopathies may therefore be facilitating factors for visual hallucinations in PD and justify more focused research on the pathophysiology of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.",

Compared to placebo, GHB reduced the daily number of hypnagogic hallucinations (from 0.87 to 0.28; p = 0.008), daytime sleep attacks (from 2.27 to 1.40; p = 0.001) and the severity of subjective daytime sleepiness (from 1.57 to 1.24 on a 0-4 scale; p = 0.028). The number of daily cataplexy attacks was reduced from 1.26 at baseline to 0.56 after 4 weeks of GHB intake. This reduction, however, was not statistically significantly different from the difference between baseline and placebo. GHB stabilized nocturnal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, i.e. it reduced the percentage of wakefulness during REM sleep (p = 0.007) and the number of awakenings out of REM sleep (p = 0.016), and tended to increase slow wave sleep (p = 0.053).

Those with erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, as evidenced through screened transnasal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, were excluded. Efficacy was assessed by RSI, RFS, and ambulatory multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) monitoring.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 80 patients aged 22 to 72 years were enrolled. Compared with baseline, both Alginos (TTY Biopharm Co.

The improvement was significantly better in Group B RSI and RFS on both follow ups. On analysis of each RSI item at 8\u00a0weeks, choking sensation showed no significant improvement in Group A. All other items showed significant improvement in both groups, with all items except difficulty swallowing and choking sensation showing significantly better improvement in Group B. Analysis of each RFS item at 8\u00a0weeks, showed significant improvement in Group B but not in Group A. The addition of alginate to PPI shows greater definitive improvement in both symptoms and signs of LPRD within a short period of 8\u00a0weeks, compared to PPI monotherapy, making it a feasible treatment option with good results in routine practice in a rural set-up.

County-wide random digit dialing telephone surveys were supplemented with door-to-door recruitment in three Arizona border communities. Utilizing a two-step screening process, individuals with a seizure disorder or epilepsy were identified. A consensus diagnosis was arrived at after reviewing results from the detailed interview, medical records and clinical examination.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 15,738 household individuals were surveyed. Two hundred and three individuals were identified as having had epilepsy at some point in their life; 25% of them were previously not diagnosed. The sex and age-adjusted prevalence estimate was 14.3 per 1000 (95% CI: 12.5-16.1) for lifetime epilepsy, and 11.8 per 1000 (CI: 10.2-13.5) for active epilepsy (seizures in the past 5 years or currently taking antiseizure medications). Non-Hispanic Whites were two times more likely to have active epilepsy than Hispanics. The majority of individuals with lifetime history of epilepsy had idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy; most were localization-related epilepsy although the exact location could not be determined for the majority. Although most individuals with epilepsy report receiving care from a neurology specialist, they were more likely to have visited a non-specialist in the past 3 months.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nThe lower prevalence of epilepsy among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics supports previous survey findings in the Southwest US and may be due to language, acculturation factors, stigma, or a reflection of the \"healthy immigrant effect\". The surprisingly high proportion of previously un-diagnosed individuals shows a need for further investigation as well as a need to increase community awareness.",

Inflammation is a substantial indicator of epilepsy risk. In this study, we evaluated whether chronic osteomyelitis (COM), a chronic inflammatory disease, increases epilepsy risk.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nA Taiwanese national insurance claims dataset of more than 22 million enrollees was used to select 20,996 COM patients and 83,973 randomly selected age- and gender-matched controls to investigate epilepsy development over an 11-year follow-up period, starting on January 1, 2000 and ending on December 31, 2010. The epilepsy risk was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.\nRESULTS\n\n\nComorbidities known to elevate epilepsy risk, including diabetes, hypertension, head injury, stroke, and cancer, were commonly noted in the COM cohort, which had considerably higher risk of epilepsy than did the control group. Comparing only those without comorbidities, COM patients still exhibited higher epilepsy risk than the control group did (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.01-4.98). The younger population exhibited an even greater risk (age \u226439 years: aHR=6.10, 95% CI: 4.00-9.30; age \u226565 years: aHR=1.66, 95% CI: 1.28-2.16).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis is the first study linking COM to an increased risk in epilepsy development. The results demonstrated that COM is a significant predictor of epilepsy. Further study of COM patients, particularly young patients, is recommended to facilitate epilepsy prevention.",

Out of this sample, 578 dropped out leaving 3066 males (51.8%) and 2854 females (48.2%). There were 3660 (61.8%) urban residents and 2260 (38.2%) from the rural community. Patients were evaluated using a screening questionnaire for epilepsy, and then referred to the hospital to be re-evaluated by a qualified neurologist and with electroencephalography (EEG) and computed tomography of the brain (CT).\nRESULTS\n\n\nSeventy-five cases were diagnosed with epilepsy giving an overall the crude lifetime prevalence rate (CPR) for epilepsy of 12.67/1000 (95% CI: 9.8-15.54). The active prevalence rate was 9.3/1000 and the incidence rate was 1.5/1000 (95% confidence interval: 0.53-2.51). Fifty-six cases (75%) had idiopathic epilepsy (CPR 9.5/1000). Symptomatic epilepsy was recorded in 19 (25%) cases (CPR 3.2/1000). Generalized seizures were more common (CPR 6.75/1000) than partial seizures (CPR 2.5/1000). The prevalence rate of partial seizures evolving to secondary generalization was 0.84/1000 while simple partial and complex partial seizures had CPR 1.4/1000 and 0.34/1000, respectively. The CPR of mixed seizures was 0.17/1000. Epilepsy was slightly but not significantly more common among males than females (CPR of 14.4 and 10.9 per 1000 population, respectively). The CPR was higher in rural than urban populations (17.7/1000, with 95% CI 12.2-23.18 and 9.56/1000, with 95% CI: 6.39-12.7, respectively) and in the illiterate group than the literate population (12.02/1000 and 9.94/1000, respectively). The highest prevalence rate was recorded in the early and late childhood period (69.78/100,000 and 43.78/100,000, respectively). Prenatal insults and infection represented major causes of symptomatic epilepsy.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe found a high prevalence rate of epilepsy (comparable with that in other Arabic and European countries) in our community particularly among children and teenagers. Overall the prevalence was higher in the rural than in the urban population. A family history of epilepsy, prenatal insults, and infection represented major risk factors of symptomatic epilepsy.",

Regression models suggested that for individuals with active epilepsy, physical activity was associated with fewer activity-limited days, whereas for individuals with inactive epilepsy, medical comorbidity was positively associated with activity-limited days. Further research is needed to increase the reliability of the findings.",

        "a6_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of using \"epileptic\" as a noun to describe someone with epilepsy have long been debated. Recent high-profile recommendations have stated that the term should not be used, including in English, as it perpetuates stigma. This decision was largely informed by a Brazilian Global Campaign Against Epilepsy study that reported experimental evidence indicating that, with students, the label evokes more negative attitudes than \"person with epilepsy\". The generalizability of this effect to different countries/cultures, and thus the justification for the recommendations, has never been tested.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe replicated the Brazilian study in the UK, in English, while also addressing methodological limitations. It was powered to detect the effects reported by the Brazilian study, with 234 students completing a survey regarding epilepsy attitudes. Half were randomized to Group 1 and half to Group 2. In Group 1, patients were referred to as \"people/person with epilepsy\" within the attitudinal measures, while in Group 2 they were referred to as \"epileptic/s\". Measures included translations of the questions used in the Brazilian study and the Attitudes and Beliefs about Living with Epilepsy scale. Participants' epilepsy familiarity and knowledge were also assessed.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe two groups were comparable in characteristics. A comparison of their responses to the attitude measures revealed no statistically significant or meaningful differences.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn this English replication, the word \"epileptic\" did not provoke more negative attitudes. This suggests that the effect reported by the Brazilian study might be culturally dependent. Methodological limitations to that study might also be relevant. Our results have implications for the global debate about how negative attitudes towards epilepsy might be addressed. Simply not saying \"epileptic\" may not promote the positive attitudes towards epilepsy that had been expected. To know how to best refer to those with epilepsy, evidence on the preferences of those actually living with epilepsy is needed.",

        "a7_doc": "PURPOSE\n\n\nTo show any possible associations between childhood-onset epilepsy and physical activity, health-related fitness, and health experience.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA population-based cohort of 176 patients with epilepsy since childhood was monitored for a mean of 35 years. Patients with recurrent, unprovoked epileptic seizures with no associated initial neurologic impairment or disability, termed those with \"epilepsy only\" (n = 100), were compared with matched controls for self-reported physical activity, health experience, laboratory tests, body mass index, and muscle power tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOn the basis of muscle tests, physical fitness proved to be significantly poorer in patients with \"epilepsy only\" than in matched controls. During the preceding year, 22% of patients and 24% of controls had reduced their physical activities because of some illness; only 2% reduced their physical activities because of epilepsy. No significant difference was found in blood status, except for a lower serum creatinine level in the patients. Current antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy appeared significantly associated with lower hemoglobin and creatinine levels and higher high-density lipoprotein values. The patients perceived their health status to be comparable with that of controls, irrespective of physical inactivity, continued seizures, or AED monotherapy. However, patients receiving AED polytherapy perceived their health as rather poor or very poor significantly more often than did controls.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nBased on objective muscle tests, adults with childhood-onset \"epilepsy only\" have poorer physical fitness than do matched controls, but they have a feeling of good personal health.",

Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric disorders independently predict epilepsy in older male veterans. Our aim was to examine the relationship between these disorders in a population-based study of older adults that also included women and minorities.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe used a national 5% random sample of 2005 Medicare beneficiaries including all 50 US states and Washington, DC. Beneficiaries were 65 years of age or older, with continuous Medicare Part A and Part B coverage and not in managed care plans. Epilepsy cases were identified from claims for physician visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient procedures. We used logistic regressions for the overall sample and stratified by gender to determine whether risk of new-onset epilepsy was associated with prior history of psychiatric (i.e., depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder, and substance abuse/dependence) and neurologic conditions (i.e., cerebrovascular disease, dementia, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, metastatic cancer).\nRESULTS\n\n\nPreexisting psychiatric disorders were significantly associated with new-onset epilepsy in the study population as were the neurologic conditions evaluated. Five of the seven psychiatric disorders examined were independently associated with new-onset epilepsy; substance abuse, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. Gender interaction effects were found for substance abuse/dependence and brain tumors.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nBoth neurologic and psychiatric factors significantly predicted new-onset epilepsy in a population-based sample of male and female older adults. These results support earlier findings and extend the understanding of risk models for new-onset epilepsy in broader older adult populations.",

Both intellectual and physical abilities of people with epilepsy were regarded as low by controls, and this opinion did not change over the study period. Observations by medical personnel also suggested stigmatizing attitudes in the community. The number of patients reporting problems with their marriage or childbearing as a result of their epilepsy did not alter over the 12-month period, unlike their estimates of their own intellectual and physical capacities which had significantly improved.

Before epilepsy was diagnosed there was no difference in overall fracture rate between patients and controls (RR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.3). After the diagnosis the overall fracture rate was significantly higher in the patients (RR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6-2.5). Fractures of the spine, forearms, femurs, lower legs, and feet and toes were significantly increased. Fractures related to seizures accounted for 33.9% (95% CI: 25.3-43.5%) of all fractures. After elimination of seizure related fractures the increase in fracture frequency was only borderline significant: RR = 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.7, P = 0.042). No difference in fracture energy between patients and controls was observed (low energy fractures: 1.7/1.4%, medium energy fractures: 59.8/52.0%, and high energy fractures: 38.3/46.6%).

Data from 30 weeks of the parent study were used for this analysis. Daily step count and sleep duration were extracted from activity monitor data, and participants self-reported knee pain, positive mood, and negative mood via surveys. Metrics were averaged within each participant and then across all participants for pre-pandemic, stay-at-home, and reopening periods, reflecting the phased re-opening in the state of Massachusetts.\nResults\n\n\nData from 28 participants showed small changes with inconclusive clinical significance during the stay-at-home and reopening periods compared to pre-pandemic for all outcomes. Summary statistics suggested substantial variability across participants with some participants showing persistent declines in physical activity during the observation period.\nConclusion\n\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, sleep, pain, and mood were variable across individuals with OA. Specific reasons for this variability could not be determined. Identifying factors that could affect individuals with knee OA who may exhibit reduced physical activity and/or worse symptoms during major lifestyle changes (such as the ongoing pandemic) is important for providing targeted healthcare services and management advice towards those that could benefit from it the most.",

Participants ( N  = 1,110) were presented with a scenario describing a positive COVID-19 test result, followed by one of eight scenarios describing a long COVID diagnosis and then completed outcome measures of illness expectations including: symptom severity, symptom duration, quality of life, personal control, treatment control, and illness coherence.\nRESULTS\n\n\nWe ran a series of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVAs on the outcome variables. We found a main effect of illness description: individuals reported longer symptom duration and less illness coherence when the illness was described as long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). There was a main effect of symptom uncertainty: when uncertainty was emphasized, participants reported longer expected symptom duration (p < .001), less treatment control ( p  = .031), and less illness coherence ( p  < .001) than when uncertainty was not emphasized. There was a main effect of efficacy of support: participants reported higher personal control ( p  = .004) and higher treatment control ( p  = .037) when support was enhanced (compared to basic support).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCommunications around long COVID should avoid emphasizing symptom uncertainty and aim to provide people with access to additional support and information on how they can facilitate their recovery.

We aimed to assess the effects of physical exercising on post-COVID-19-symptoms, physical/mental capacities and workability within a workplace-health-promotion project in health-care personnel.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nThirty-two HCWs were enrolled in two groups based on Post-COVID-Functional Scale (PCFS) scores: (1) severe (SSG,  n \u2009=\u200911) and (2) mild (MSG,  n \u2009=\u200921) symptoms. The participants underwent an eight week exercise intervention program consisting of two supervised resistance exercise sessions per week plus individual aerobic exercise recommendations. Primary outcome-parameter for physical fitness was VO 2 peak. Further, physical function (6MWT, 30\u2009s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS)), mental health (anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), stress (PSS-10), fatigue (BFI), resilience (BRS)), cognitive capacity (MoCA) and workability (WAI) were assessed at baseline, after 4\u00a0weeks and after completion of exercise intervention.\nRESULTS\n\n\nVO 2 peak improved significantly in the SSG by 2.4\u2009ml/kg/min (95% CI [1.48; 3.01], adj. p \u2009<\u20090.001) and non-significantly in the MSG by 1.27\u2009ml/kg/min (adj. p \u2009=\u20090.096). Both groups significantly improved their 30secSTS ( p \u2009=\u20090.0236) and 6MWT ( p \u2009=\u20090.0252) outcomes in both follow-ups (4\u00a0weeks and 8\u00a0weeks after inclusion). The SSG improved more than the MSG in VO 2 peak and 6MWT both after 4 and 8\u00a0weeks, respectively, although not statistically significant; findings were vice versa for the 30secSTS. 30secSTS outcomes correlated significantly with mental health outcomes and workability.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nPost-COVID exercise intervention improved physical fitness, psychological outcomes and workability in HCWs. Cases with severe fatigue showed higher benefit levels compared to those with mild symptoms. The safe and highly feasible 30secSTS correlated well with physical and mental outcomes and better workability in COVID-19 survivors.Implications for rehabilitationPhysical exercising showed to be an effective intervention method in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID syndrome by positively affecting both physical and mental health.In health care workers suffering from post-COVID syndrome, increases in physical performance are directly related to improvements in work ability.The 30\u2009s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS) showed promising results as clinical assessment tool.The results of this study indicate that physical exercising will need to play a large and substantial role over the next years in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID-19-syndrome as it positively affects both physical and mental dimensions of the post-COVID-19-syndrome as well as work ability.",

Fatigue and dyspnea seem to be the most prevalent post-COVID symptoms.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo analyze whether a tele-rehabilitation exercise program is able to improve self-perceived physical exertion in patients with post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSixty-eight COVID-19 survivors exhibiting post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea derived to four Primary Health Care centers located in Madrid were enrolled in this quasi-experimental study. A tele-rehabilitation program based on patient education, physical activity, airway clearing, and breathing exercise interventions was structured on eighteen sessions (3 sessions/week). Self-perceived physical exertion during daily living activities, dyspnea severity, health-related quality of life and distance walked and changes in oxygen saturation and heart rate during the 6-Minute walking test were assessed at baseline, after the program and at 1- and 3-months follow-up periods.\nRESULTS\n\n\nDaily living activities, dyspnea severity and quality of life improved significantly at all follow-ups (p<0.001). Additionally, a significant increase in oxygen saturation before and after the 6-Minute Walking test was found when compared with baseline (P<0.001). Heart rate adaptations at rest were found during the follow-up periods (P = 0.012). Lower perceived exertion before and after the 6-Minute Walking test were also observed, even if larger distance were walked (P<0.001).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nTele-rehabilitation programs could be an effective strategy to reduce post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea in COVID-19 survivors.

In fact, it has been proposed that physical exercise may modulate the immune system. However, the potential effect of an exercise program on COVID-19 survivors has not been investigated. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the modifications in immunological parameters, physical condition, inflammatory profile, and perceived persistent symptoms after 6 weeks of supervised resistance training (RT), in addition to the standard care on the clinical status of patients with persistent COVID-19 symptoms. The objective of this protocol is to describe the scientific rationale in detail and to provide information about the study procedures.\nMETHODS/DESIGN\n\n\nA total of 100 patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19 will be randomly allocated into either a group receiving standard care (control group) or a group performing a multicomponent exercise program two times a week over a period of 6 weeks. The main hypothesis is that a 6-week multicomponent exercise program (EXER-COVID Crossover Study) will improve the immunological and inflammatory profile, physical condition, and persistent perceived symptoms (fatigue/tiredness, musculoskeletal pain, and shortness of breath) in patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nOur results will provide insights into the effects of a multicomponent exercise program on immunological parameters, physical condition, inflammatory profile, and persistent perceived symptoms in patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19.

However, studies evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on athletes' exercise activity are limited.\nObjectives\n\n\nThe objectives of this study were: (i) to describe the perceptions of recreational runners and cyclists recovering from COVID-19 on their training activity and general well-being, (ii) to compare device-measured training data in runners and cyclists pre- and post COVID-19, with non-infected controls that had a training interruption.\nMethods\n\n\nParticipants who were recruited via social media completed an online questionnaire (n=61), including demographic, health and COVID-19 descriptive data. In a sub-sample, device-measured training data (heart rate, time, distance and speed, n=27) were obtained from GPS devices for four weeks before infection and on resumption of training. Similar data were collected for the control group (n=9) whose training had been interrupted but by factors excluding COVID-19.\nResults\n\n\nMost participants experienced a mild to moderate illness (91%) that was associated with a training interruption time of two-four weeks. Decreases in heart rate, relative exercise intensity, speed, time and distance were observed during the first week of returning to training for both groups, followed by an increase from Week two onwards.\nDiscussion\n\n\nResults failed to support a 'COVID-19 effect' on exercise activity as reductions in training variables occurred in both the COVID-19 and control groups. A possible explanation for the reductions observed is a deliberate gradual return to training by athletes post-COVID-19.\nConclusion\n\n\nMore research is needed using device-measured training data prior to and post COVID-19 infection to better understand the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the exercise activity of athletes.",

The current cross-sectional study characterized relationships between neighborhood deprivation and perceived changes in pain-related experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (early-September to mid-October 2020) for adult patients (N\u2009=\u200997) with nonspecific chronic low back pain.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe collected self-report perceived experiences from participants enrolled in an ongoing pragmatic randomized trial across medical centers within the Salt Lake City, Utah and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitans. The Area Deprivation Index (composite of 17\u2009US Census deprivation metrics) reflected neighborhood deprivation based on participants' zip codes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAlthough those living in the neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed significantly poorer physical (pain severity, pain interference, physical functioning), mental (depression, anxiety), and social health during the pandemic, there were no significant differences for perceived changes in pain-related experiences (pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality) between levels of neighborhood deprivation since the onset of the pandemic. However, those in neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed disproportionately worse perceived changes in pain coping, social support, and mood since the pandemic.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe current findings offer evidence that changes in pain coping during the pandemic may be disproportionately worse for those living in deprived areas. Considering poorer pain coping may contribute to long-term consequences, the current findings suggest the need for further attention and intervention to reduce the negative effect of the pandemic for such vulnerable populations.",

However, carbohydrate restriction may have weight-independent beneficial effects on glycaemic control. This has been difficult to demonstrate because low-carbohydrate diets readily decrease body weight. We hypothesised that carbohydrate restriction enhances the beneficial metabolic effects of weight loss in type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis open-label, parallel RCT included adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA 1c  48-97\u00a0mmol/mol (6.5-11%), BMI >25\u00a0kg/m 2 , eGFR >30\u00a0ml\u00a0min -1  [1.73\u00a0m] -2  and glucose-lowering therapy restricted to metformin or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Participants were randomised by a third party and assigned to 6\u00a0weeks of energy restriction (all foods were provided) aiming at ~6% weight loss with either a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet (CRHP, percentage of total energy intake [E%]: CH30/P30/F40) or a conventional diabetes diet (CD, E%: CH50/P17/F33). Fasting blood samples, continuous glucose monitoring and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to assess glycaemic control, lipid metabolism and intrahepatic fat. Change in HbA 1c  was the primary outcome; changes in circulating and intrahepatic triacylglycerol were secondary outcomes. Data were collected at Copenhagen University Hospital (Bispebjerg and Herlev).\nRESULTS\n\n\nSeventy-two adults (CD 36, CRHP 36, all white, 38 male sex) with type 2 diabetes (mean duration 8\u00a0years, mean HbA 1c  57\u00a0mmol/mol [7.4%]) and mean BMI of 33\u00a0kg/m 2  were enrolled, of which 67 (CD 33, CRHP 34) completed the study. Body weight decreased by 5.8\u00a0kg (5.9%) in both groups after 6\u00a0weeks. Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet further reduced HbA 1c  (mean [95% CI] -1.9 [-3.5, -0.3] mmol/mol [-0.18 (-0.32, -0.03)%], p\u2009=\u20090.018) and diurnal mean glucose (mean [95% CI] -0.8 [-1.2, -0.4] mmol/l, p\u00a0<\u20090.001), stabilised glucose excursions by reducing glucose CV (mean [95% CI] -4.1 [-5.9, -2.2]%, p\u00a0<\u20090.001), and augmented the reductions in fasting triacylglycerol concentration (by mean [95% CI] -18 [-29, -6]%, p\u00a0<\u20090.01) and liver fat content (by mean [95% CI] -26 [-45, 0]%, p\u2009=\u20090.051). However, pancreatic fat content was decreased to a lesser extent by the CRHP than the CD diet (mean [95% CI] 33 [7, 65]%, p\u2009=\u20090.010). Fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA2-IR and cholesterol concentrations (total, LDL and HDL) were reduced significantly and similarly by both diets.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION\n\n\nModerate carbohydrate restriction for 6\u00a0weeks modestly improved glycaemic control, and decreased circulating and intrahepatic triacylglycerol levels beyond the effects of weight loss itself compared with a CD diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Concurrent differences in protein and fat intakes, and the quality of dietary macronutrients, may have contributed to these results and should be explored in future studies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03814694.\nFUNDING\n\n\nThe study was funded by Arla Foods amba, The Danish Dairy Research Foundation, and Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg Frederiksberg.",

During the course of the disease intensive treatment is often necessary resulting in multiple interventions including administration of insulin. Although dietary intervention is highly recommended, the clinical results of the widely prescribed diets with low fat content and high carbohydrates are disappointing. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the effect of dietary carbohydrate-restriction in conjunction with metformin and liraglutide on metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS\n\n\nForty patients with type 2 diabetes already being treated with two oral anti-diabetic drugs or insulin treatment and who showed deterioration of their glucose metabolism (i.e. HbA1c >7.5), were treated. A carbohydrate-restricted diet and a combination of metformin and liraglutide were instituted, after stopping either insulin or oral anti-diabetic drugs (excluding metformin). After enrollment, the study patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at one, two, three and six months. Primary outcome was glycemic control, measured by HbA1c at six months. Secondary outcomes were body weight, lipid-profile and treatment satisfaction.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThirty-five (88%) participants completed the study. Nearly all participating patients experienced a drop in HbA1c and body weight during the first three months, an effect which was maintained until the end of the study at six months. Seventy-one percent of the patients reached HbA1c values below 7.0%. The range of body weight at enrollment was extreme, reaching 165 kg as the highest initial value. The average weight loss after 6 months was 10%. Most patients were satisfied with this treatment. During the intervention no significant change of lipids was observed. Most patients who were on insulin could maintain the treatment without insulin with far better metabolic control.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCarbohydrate restriction in conjunction with metformin and liraglutide is an effective treatment option for patients with advanced diabetes who are candidates for instituting insulin or who are in need of intensified insulin treatment.

The present study aimed to provide insight into the relationship between carbohydrate restriction and glycaemia by testing the effect of varying doses of carbohydrate on continuous glucose concentrations within a range of intakes defined as low-carbohydrate at the same time as controlling for confounding factors.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a randomised crossover trial in participants with T2D (HbA1c: 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6%, 49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u2009mmol mol -1  ) testing five different 6-day eucaloric dietary treatments with varying carbohydrate content (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% kcal). Diets exchanged %kcal from carbohydrate with fat, keeping protein constant at 15% kcal. Daily self-weighing was employed to ensure weight stability throughout each treatment arm. Between dietary treatments, participants underwent a washout period of at least 7 days and were advised to maintain their habitual diet. Glycaemic control was assessed using a continuous glucose monitoring device.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTwelve participants completed the study.

Interpretation of results from different studies on dietary strategies may be complex since there is often no consistency in diet compositions, calorie restriction, intensity of intervention, dietary assessment or extent of adherence in the trial. Nevertheless, it seems that low fat restricted calorie diets are effective for weight loss and are associated with some metabolic benefits; however, some recent trials have shown that low carbohydrate diets are as efficient in inducing weight loss and in some metabolic measures such as serum triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol may be even superior to low fat diets. When addressing the issue of diet quality rather than quantity applying the glycemic index may have some added benefits. Furthermore special features of the Mediterranean diet have apparent additional favorable effects for patients with T2DM.",

This is due, in part, to increased hepatic synthesis of fat from carbohydrates via lipogenesis. Although weight loss is currently recommended to treat NAFLD, little attention has been given to dietary carbohydrate restriction.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of 2 wk of dietary carbohydrate and calorie restriction at reducing hepatic triglycerides in subjects with NAFLD.\nDESIGN\n\n\nEighteen NAFLD subjects (n = 5 men and 13 women) with a mean (\u00b1SD) age of 45 \u00b1 12 y and a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 35 \u00b1 7 consumed a carbohydrate-restricted (<20 g/d) or calorie-restricted (1200-1500 kcal/d) diet for 2 wk. Hepatic triglycerides were measured before and after intervention by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\nRESULTS\n\n\nMean (\u00b1SD) weight loss was similar between the groups (-4.0 \u00b1 1.5 kg in the calorie-restricted group and -4.6 \u00b1 1.5 kg in the carbohydrate-restricted group; P = 0.363). Liver triglycerides decreased significantly with weight loss (P < 0.001) but decreased significantly more (P = 0.008) in carbohydrate-restricted subjects (-55 \u00b1 14%) than in calorie-restricted subjects (-28 \u00b1 23%). Dietary fat (r = 0.643, P = 0.004), carbohydrate (r = -0.606, P = 0.008), posttreatment plasma ketones (r = 0.755, P = 0.006), and respiratory quotient (r = -0.797, P < 0.001) were related to a reduction in liver triglycerides. Plasma aspartate, but not alanine, aminotransferase decreased significantly with weight loss (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nTwo weeks of dietary intervention (\u22484.3% weight loss) reduced hepatic triglycerides by \u224842% in subjects with NAFLD; however, reductions were significantly greater with dietary carbohydrate restriction than with calorie restriction. This may have been due, in part, to enhanced hepatic and whole-body oxidation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01262326.",

        "a10_doc": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic condition that is considerably prevalent across the world. Dietary intakes, in which macronutrient composition is precisely planned, might be able to reduce inflammation, steatosis and fibrosis among patients with NAFLD. A moderately carbohydrate restricted diet with weight loss has been demonstrated to improve liver fat content among overweight or obese patients. However, there is no information about the appropriateness of such a restriction, without weight loss, in normal-weight patients. This randomised clinical trial will be aimed at assessing the effect of moderate carbohydrate restriction on liver enzymes, liver steatosis and fibrosis in normal-weight patients with NAFLD.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\n\n\nThis randomised controlled clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the impact of a moderately carbohydrate restricted diet on liver enzymes, steatosis and fibrosis in 52 eligible normal-weight individuals with NAFLD. Transient elastography and controlled attenuation parameter with FibroScan will be applied to diagnose NAFLD. After individual matching based on body mass index, age and sex, patients will be randomly assigned to receive a moderately carbohydrate restricted diet or an isocaloric diet without carbohydrate restriction for 12 weeks. The primary and secondary outcomes in this study will be liver function indices, including liver steatosis and fibrosis, metabolic parameters and anthropometric measures. All these variables will be assessed at study baseline and postintervention.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\n\n\nThe present clinical trial study was accepted by the ethics committee of TUMS (Tehran University of Medical Sciences) (code: IR.TUMS.MEDICINE.REC.1400.116).\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\n\n\nIRCT20210119050086N1.",

Distraction methods and vapocoolant sprays may be use to modify the parent's perceptions of their child's pain and anxiety, thus encouraging parents to return for the child's next vaccination.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA convenience sample of 68 parents with children ranging in age from 2 to 12 years was selected. The parents and the child were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a DVD distraction group, or a vapocoolant spray group. After the child was vaccinated, parents evaluated the child's pain and anxiety.\nRESULTS\n\n\nNo significant difference in the parents' perception of their child's pain or anxiety was found between the two treatment groups compared with the control group. Some parents expressed the desire to be able to choose the type of distraction method their child received rather than having them randomly assigned to a group.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nAlthough quantitative results were not statistically significant in this pilot study, parents commented that the DVD distraction method seemed helpful before and/or after vaccination, but not during vaccination, and parents appreciated the distraction. Parents, however, would prefer to choose the intervention rather than being randomly assigned to a group. The effectiveness of interventions with regard to parental perceptions of pain or anxiety warrants further study.",

Secondary analyses included shorter risk periods and restricted age categories.\nDESIGN\n\n\nSelf-control screening analysis. Children vaccinated from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1999, were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. In group 1, risks of outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient visits during the 14 days after vaccination were compared with the risks of visits in 2 control periods. Significant plausible medically attended events identified in group 1 were then analyzed in group 2, using the same 2 control periods. Medically attended events significant in both groups were considered potentially associated with vaccination and were assessed by medical record review.\nSETTING\n\n\nFive managed care organizations in the United States.\nPARTICIPANTS\n\n\nChildren younger than 18 years who received an influenza vaccination in one of the managed care settings (N = 251 600).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\n\nAmong vaccinated children seen for a medically attended event, the odds of the visit occurring in the 2 weeks after vaccination vs during 1 of the 2 control periods.\nRESULTS\n\n\nStudy participants incurred 1165, 230, and 489 different diagnoses during the 14 days after vaccination according to the outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient data, respectively. Four diagnoses were positively associated with the vaccine in both groups 1 and 2: impetigo, dermatitis, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, and ureteral disorder not otherwise specified. After medical record review, impetigo (9 cases) in children 6 to 23 months old remained significantly associated with vaccination.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis large screening safety study did not reveal any evidence of important medically attended events associated with pediatric influenza vaccination.",

However, there is concern that vaccination may cause exacerbations of asthma.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTo investigate the safety of the inactivated trivalent split-virus influenza vaccine in adults and children with asthma, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 2032 patients with asthma (age range, 3 to 64 years). The order of injection of vaccine and placebo was assigned randomly, with a mean of 22 days between the injections. Each day during the two weeks after each injection, the patients recorded peak expiratory flow rates, symptoms thought to be related to the injection, use of asthma medications, unscheduled health care visits for asthma, and asthma-related absences from school or work. The primary outcome measure was an exacerbation of asthma in the two weeks after the injections.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe frequency of exacerbations of asthma was similar in the two weeks after the influenza vaccination and after placebo injection (28.8 percent and 27.7 percent, respectively; absolute difference, 1.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.4 percent to 3.6 percent). The exacerbation rates were similar in subgroups defined according to age, severity of asthma, and other factors. Among symptoms thought to be associated with the injection, only body aches were more frequent after the vaccine injection than after placebo injection (25.1 percent vs. 20.8 percent, P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe inactivated influenza vaccine is safe to administer to adults and children with asthma, including those with severe asthma.

The parent and the injection nurse assigned fear scores on a scale of 0 to 10 after each injection visit.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt the time of analysis, children had a median of 49 injection visits (range, 12-88) during a median study period of 81.5 weeks (range, 15-165 weeks). Fifteen children (83%) lost their fear of injections during the study. A fear score of 0 was achieved after a mean of 8.4 visits (SD, 7.4).

Controls were randomly selected at a 3:1 ratio from among the remaining 6,813 screening participants using frequency-matched age and sex groupings.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SAIDs among those >or=65 years of age who had worked for the vermiculite mining company were 2.14 (95% CI, 0.90-5.10) for all SAIDs and 3.23 (95% CI, 1.31-7.96) for RA. In this age group, exposure to asbestos while in the military was also an independent risk factor, resulting in a tripling in risk. Other measures of occupational exposure to vermiculite indicated 54% and 65% increased risk for SAIDs and RA, respectively. Those who had reported frequent contact with vermiculite through various exposure pathways also demonstrated elevated risk for SAIDs and RA. We found increasing risk estimates for SAIDs with increasing numbers of reported vermiculite exposure pathways (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThese preliminary findings support the hypothesis that asbestos exposure is associated with autoimmune disease. Refined measurements of asbestos exposure and SAID status among this cohort will help to further clarify the relationship between these variables.",

Here, we tracked the longitudinal changes in gut bacteria in 22 RA patients who were randomized into two groups and treated with Huayu-Qiangshen-Tongbi formula (HQT) plus methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide (LEF) plus MTX. There were differences in the gut microbiome between untreated (at baseline) RA patients and healthy controls, with 37 species being more abundant in the RA patients and 21 species (including  Clostridium celatum ) being less abundant. Regarding the functional analysis, vitamin K2 biosynthesis was associated with RA-enriched bacteria. Additionally, in RA patients, alterations in gut microbial species appeared to be associated with RA-related clinical indicators through changing various gut microbiome functional pathways. The clinical efficacy of the two treatments was further observed to be similar, but the response trends of RA-related clinical indices in the two treatment groups differed. For example, HQT treatment affected the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), while LEF treatment affected the C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Further, 11 species and 9 metabolic pathways significantly changed over time in the HQT group (including  C. celatum , which increased), while only 4 species and 2 metabolic pathways significantly changed over time in the LEF group. In summary, we studied the alterations in the gut microbiome of RA patients being treated with HQT or LEF.

        "a9_doc": "The notion that dietary factors may influence rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been a part of the folklore of the disease, but scientific support for this has been sparse. In a controlled, single-blind trial we tested the effect of fasting for 7-10 d, then consuming an individually adjusted, gluten-free, vegan diet for 3.5 mo, and then consuming an individually adjusted lactovegetarian diet for 9 mo on patients with RA. For all clinical variables and most laboratory variables measured, the 27 patients in the fasting and vegetarian diet groups improved significantly compared with the 26 patients in the control group who followed their usual omnivorous diet throughout the study period. One year after the patients completed the trial, they were reexamined. Compared with baseline, the improvements measured were significantly greater in the vegetarians who previously benefited from the diet (diet responders) than in diet nonresponders and omnivores. The beneficial effect could not be explained by patients' psychologic characteristics, antibody activity against food antigens, or changes in concentrations of prostaglandin and leukotriene precursors. However, the fecal flora differed significantly between samples collected at time points at which there was substantial clinical improvement and time points at which there were no or only minor improvements.

        "text": "Mold and RA\nI'm having a bit of a weird issue with mold. I'm currently in the process of being diagnosed with RA. I've got achy joints, swelling whole nine yards. I transferred job locations earlier this month and was starting to feel better and my hand swelling finally went down. I then signed up for some overtime in my old job location and after about 2 hours my elbows and hands started to ache and swell. Every time it rains at this building water runs through the walls. I'm certain theirs mold in the walls. Google says long-term toxic mold exposure can mimic RA. Had anyone else had an experience with RA symptoms not ending up being RA or having one large trigger to RA symptoms. After going home and sleeping on things my hands started to feel better but not completely.",
