Last time they told me they cant medicate me because my bp dropped pretty low during the TTT. However, at rest my bp is normal and even standing up it doesnt drop noticeably low unless Im standing still for a longer period of time. So I just wanted to know if any of yall are in a similar situation and have good (or bad) experiences with this drug. I hear midodrine is good for low bp but its more expensive and the side effects sound kind of iffy to me.",

        "a1_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nPostural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common form of chronic orthostatic intolerance. The remarkable increase in heart rate (HR) upon standing is the hallmark of this syndrome. Treatment of POTS patients is challenging and includes drugs that slow the HR. Ivabradine is a selective If channel blocker designed to slow the HR, as an anti-anginal agent. In view of its ability to slow the HR, we posited that ivabradine may be an ideal medication for treating POTS patients. This report provides the results of an investigation in which we studied ivabradine's effect on the hemodynamics and sympathovagal balance in POTS patients.\nMETHODS\n\n\nAn open-label trial, without a placebo control, was performed in eight patients with POTS of two years' standing. Characterization of symptoms, hemodynamics, autonomic function tests, and HR and blood pressure (BP) variability were determined while patients were in a supine position and during a 20-minute head-up tilt before and after a single oral dose of 7.5 mg ivabradine.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIvabradine slowed the HR of POTS patients at rest by 4\u00b11 bpm (P<0.05). During a 5-minute head-up tilt, the HR decreased from 118\u00b14 bpm to 101\u00b15 bpm (P<0.01). Ivabradine did not affect the BP when patients were at rest in a supine position or in head-up tilt position. Cardiovascular vagal and sympathetic tone, extrapolated from the time and frequency domains of the HR and BP variability, were also not affected by ivabradine.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIvabradine is an effective drug for slowing the HR of POTS patients at rest and during tilting, without producing significant adverse effects. Moreover, ivabradine exerts its effects without influencing the sympathovagal balance.",

        "a5_doc": "Several studies have demonstrated the correlation of heart rate (HR) and image quality in coronary computed tomography angiography. Beta-blocker administration is critical because of its negative inotropic effect. Ivabradine is a selective HR-lowering agent that exclusively inhibits the I(f) current in sinoatrial node cells without having any effect on cardiac contractility or atrioventricular conduction. A total of 120 patients were randomized to oral premedication with ivabradine 15 mg or metoprolol 50 mg. HR and blood pressure (BP) were measured before the administration of premedication and immediately before coronary computed tomographic angiography. The mean time between premedication administration and follow-up was 108 \u00b1 21.5 minutes for ivabradine and 110 \u00b1 22.2 minutes for metoprolol (p = NS). When comparing groups, there were no significant differences in reduction of HR (-11.83 \u00b1 8.6 vs -13.20 \u00b1 7.8 beats/min, p = NS) and diastolic BP (-5.05 \u00b1 14.2 mm Hg vs -4.08 \u00b1 10.8 mm Hg, p = NS), whereas the decrease of systolic BP was significantly lower in patients who received ivabradine compared to those in the metoprolol group (-3.95 \u00b1 13.6 vs -13.65 \u00b1 17.3 mm Hg, p <0.001).

At the first stage, 15 patients were randomized to ivabradine with its dose titration during 2 weeks; the other 16 patients were to atenolol. At the second stage, 10 patients were switched from ivabradine used at Stage 1 to atenolol 100 mg/day, other 10 patients who were on atenolol were switched to ivabradine 15 mg/day, and 11 patients received combination therapy with ivabradine + atenolol in half doses. All the patients underwent treadmill exercise testing and applanation tonometry.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAtenolol, unlike ivabradine, lowered brachial blood pressure and unchanged the central index of its increment, which was associated with LV systolic elongation. On the contrary, ivabradine decreased the central increment index and exerted no significant effect on the duration of LV systole. By comparatively lowering heart rate, ivabradine as well as atenolol reduced pulse wave propagation velocity.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIf ivabradine or atenolol is insufficiently effective or poorly tolerated, there may be an interchange of the drugs, as well as their combination in half doses without substantially affecting their therapeutic action in patients with stable angina pectoris without LV systolic dysfunction.",

Currently used drugs like \u03b2-blocker, \u03b12 agonist or sedative analgesic have their own limitations like combined negative ionotropic and chronotropic action, and unwanted bradycardia associated with hypotension, respectively. In this context, ivabradine has been used extensively in cases of cardiac failure, myocardial ischemia and cardiomyopathies for its funny channel associated dependable heart rate reducing property. Hence, for the first time, in search of a better agent for perioperative hemodynamic stabilization, the present study evaluated the role of ivabradine in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgeries.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a prospective, observer blind, randomized, interventional pilot study, conducted among 50 patients belonging undergoing elective abdominal laparoscopic surgeries, under general anesthesia. The study group patients received ivabradine tablet 7.5 mg, 2 h before scheduled time of surgery with a sip of water. All the patients received standardized balanced general anesthesia as practiced in our institute with all standard monitoring with additional minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) monitoring to ensure an adequate depth of anesthesia, and neuromuscular monitoring to ensure adequate and standard muscle relaxation. Hemodynamic stability of the groups was tested by comparing them at time points like induction, incision and operation, and extubation. Mean values of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were compared between groups, and also for variation with lapse of time, using RMANOVA analysis, using baseline parameters as covariate so as to standardize them.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOn multivariate analysis using Wilk's lambda multivariate test, there was a statistically significant difference (F = 3.587, P = 0.036) in HR between the groups with time, while no significant difference of SBP, DBP and MAP between the groups with time.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe study revealed a significant attenuation of HR response to stressful events like laryngoscopy, intubation and surgical incision with ivabradine.

Prior to beginning of the therapy, patients were assessed with TCI. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was used as the outcome measure completed at the baseline and follow-up at 4 months.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn the combined group (n=35), Harm Avoidance was associated with the severity of the depression measured by the HDRS at the baseline (P=0.01) and baseline Self-Directedness with the HDRS at 4 months follow-up (P=0.03). In the fluoxetine treatment group, Reward Dependence (P=0.03), Self-Directedness (P=0.01) and Cooperativeness (P=0.02) at the baseline associated with HDRS at 4 months follow-up. No statistically significant associations between personality traits and depression scores at the follow-up were found in the patients treated with psychotherapy.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIn this whole cohort of depressive patients, baseline high Self-Directedness predicted higher depression scores after 4 months of treatment. In the fluoxetine treatment group, subjects with high baseline Reward Dependence, Self-Directedness or Cooperativeness were likely more severely depressed at the 4 months follow-up.

Studies have confirmed the efficacy of a several antidepressants in the treatment of atypical depression. Whether their pathological dimensions of personality diminish after benefitting from effective medication treatment is unclear.\nAIMS\n\n\nTo determine the extent that pathological dimensions of character improved among patients who benefitted from treatment.\nMETHOD\n\n\nOne-hundred and fifty-four outpatients with DSM-IV Major Depression who met Columbia criteria for atypical depression were randomized to receive fluoxetine, imipramine or placebo for a 10-week double-blind clinical trial. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was administered at the initiation of treatment and 8 weeks later. Low scores on either of two Character dimensions (Self-Directiveness or Cooperativeness) indicate psychopathology.\nRESULTS\n\n\nResponders had a substantial reduction in Harm Avoidance, but post-treatment scores remained significantly higher than the normal control group (NCG). Fluoxetine and Imipramine did not produce different changes on personality, except for Self-Transcendence.\nLIMITATIONS\n\n\nHigh proportion of missing data, inadequate sample size, post-hoc analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAmong responders, Self-Directiveness improved and normalized; Harm Avoidance also improved but did not normalize.

The data were analyzed in terms of the subjects' scores on the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire, a 100-item self-report instrument that measures four temperamental dimensions: harm avoidance, reward dependence, novelty seeking, and persistence.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt baseline, the harm avoidance scores of the dysthymic subjects were approximately 1.5 standard deviations higher than those of a previously reported community sample. After treatment, there was a significant decrease in harm avoidance scores, with no significant between-group differences. Remission of dysthymia was associated with significantly greater improvement in harm avoidance, with the greatest numerical change found in the patients treated with sertraline. Subjects' Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire scores were correlated at a 0.50 level with the Social Adjustment Scale both pre- and posttreatment, suggesting that a high degree of harm avoidance may be associated with poor social functioning.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nBefore treatment, chronically depressed patients demonstrate an abnormality in temperament, as measured by elevated degrees of harm avoidance.

The advantage of paroxetine over placebo in antidepressant efficacy was no longer significant after controlling for change in neuroticism (P = .46) or extraversion (P = .14). Patients taking paroxetine reported 6.8 times as much change on neuroticism and 3.5 times as much change on extraversion as placebo patients matched for depression improvement. Although placebo patients exhibited substantial depression improvement (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, -1.2 SD, P < .001), they reported little change on neuroticism (-0.18 SD, P = .08) or extraversion (0.08 SD, P = .50). Cognitive therapy produced greater personality change than placebo (P </= .01); but its advantage on neuroticism was no longer significant after controlling for depression (P = .14). Neuroticism reduction during treatment predicted lower relapse rates among paroxetine responders (P = .003) but not among cognitive therapy responders (P = .86).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nParoxetine appears to have a specific pharmacological effect on personality that is distinct from its effect on depression.

Temperament, specifically those associated with negative emotionality (neuroticism, harm avoidance) may predict response to SSRI treatment. The objective of this study was to determine whether baseline neuroticism and harm avoidance scores would be associated with reduced aggression (as measured by the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified [OAS-M] aggression scores) after SSRI treatment. Participants participating in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of fluoxetine completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (n=57) and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (n=38) before entering the treatment trial. Multiple regression analyses (accounting for baseline OAS-M aggression scores) revealed that pretreatment eysenck personality questionnaire neuroticism and tridimensional personality questionnaire harm avoidance independently and uniquely predicted OAS-M aggression scores at endpoint in the fluoxetine, but not placebo, treated group. These preliminary findings are the first from a placebo-controlled clinical trial to suggest that temperamental factors such as neuroticism and harm avoidance can partly explain the observed variability in treatment response in SSRI treated individuals with impulsive aggression and prompt future prospective studies examining personality dimensions as predictors of outcomes in clinical trials.",

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely used to treat depressive symptoms post-stroke but whether they reduce apathetic symptoms is unknown. We determined the effect of fluoxetine on post-stroke apathy in a post hoc analysis of the EFFECTS (Efficacy oF Fluoxetine-a randomized Controlled Trial in Stroke) trial.\nMETHODS\n\n\nEFFECTS enrolled patients \u2a7e18\u2009years between 2 and 15\u2009days after stroke onset. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral fluoxetine 20\u2009mg once daily or matching placebo for 6\u2009months. The Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was administered at baseline and 6\u2009months. Individual items on this scale were divided into those reflecting symptoms of apathy and depression. Symptoms were compared between fluoxetine and placebo groups.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 1500 participants enrolled, complete MADRS data were available for 1369. The modified intention-to-treat population included 681 patients in the fluoxetine group and 688 in the placebo group. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that apathetic, depressive, and anhedonic symptoms were dissociable. Apathy scores increased in both fluoxetine and placebo groups (both p\u2009\u2a7d\u20090.00001). In contrast, fluoxetine was associated with a reduction in depressive scores (p\u2009=\u20090.002).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nPost-stroke apathetic and depressive symptoms respond differently to fluoxetine treatment. Our analysis suggests fluoxetine is ineffective in preventing post-stroke apathy.",

A reduction in harm avoidance and an increase in self-directedness and cooperativeness, as measured by the Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), have been reported in psychiatric patients receiving treatment with serotonergic antidepressants. However, some of these changes have been associated with clinical improvement. The present study therefore used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design to examine the role of the serotonergic system on these personality factors in the normal population. Twenty healthy male volunteers were randomly allocated to either placebo (n = 9) or citalopram treatment (n = 11) for 2 weeks. Baseline depression and anxiety scores were low and did not differ between groups. The TCI was administered pre- and post-treatment. There were no baseline differences on any TCI factor between groups. Citalopram induced a significant increase in self-directedness (p < 0.05) but not cooperativeness or harm avoidance ratings after treatment. Thus, citalopram has effects on personality aspects which appear to be separate from its antidepressant properties.",

        "a10_doc": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe serotonergic neurotransmitter system is closely linked to depression and personality traits. It is not known if selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have an effect on neuroticism that is independent of their effect on depression. Healthy individuals with a genetic liability for depression represent a group of particular interest when investigating if intervention with SSRIs affects personality. The present trial is the first to test the hypothesis that escitalopram may reduce neuroticism in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with major depressive disorder (MD).\nMETHODS\n\n\nThe trial used a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled parallel-group design. We examined the effect of four weeks escitalopram 10 mg daily versus matching placebo on personality in 80 people who had a biological parent or sibling with a history of MD. The outcome measure on personality traits was change in self-reported neuroticism scores on the Revised Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness-Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPQ) from entry until end of four weeks of intervention.\nRESULTS\n\n\nWhen compared with placebo, escitalopram did not significantly affect self-reported NEO-PI-R and EPQ neuroticism and extroversion, EPQ psychoticism, NEO-PI-R openness, or NEO-PI-R conscientiousness (p all above 0.05). However, escitalopram increased NEO-PI-R agreeableness scores significantly compared with placebo (mean; SD) (2.38; 8.09) versus (-1.32; 7.94), p\u200a=\u200a0.046), but not following correction for multiplicity. A trend was shown for increased conscientiousness (p\u200a=\u200a0.07). There was no significant effect on subclinical depressive symptoms (p\u200a=\u200a0.6).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIn healthy first-degree relatives of patients with MD, there is no effect of escitalopram on neuroticism, but it is possible that escitalopram may increase the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT00386841.",

The association of these symptoms with response to treatment was assessed by logistic regression.\nRESULTS\n\n\nWe found significant decreases in PI and P during acute treatment phase for fluoxetine responders and nonresponders, although only 10.3% and 7.5% of patients experienced a >50% reduction in PI and P scores, respectively. Neither PI nor P scores significantly predicted time to relapse. P scores predicted a lower response rate to treatment with fluoxetine.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThe results of the present study suggest that there is a significant relationship between the presence of psychoticism in patients with nonpsychotic MDD, and the likelihood of overall depressive symptom improvement following a trial of monotherapy with fluoxetine.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAn increased burden of psychoticism in depressed subjects may confer poorer response to fluoxetine, but not increased risk of relapse among fluoxetine responders.",

There is also tentative evidence to suggest that these concurrent symptoms might be related to delusional and hallucinatory content. Our aim was to assess the cross-sectional associations between anxiety and depression, and hallucination and delusion severity and distress in a sample of 327 people dually diagnosed with psychosis and substance misuse problems. In addition, the relationships between specific symptom content and levels of anxiety and depression were examined. Anxiety was associated with delusion distress and depression with hallucination distress, although neither was related to symptom severity. Auditory commands to harm or kill the self were associated with higher levels of depression. Delusions with themes pertaining to the paranormal, and those with references to celebrities were associated with lower levels of depression. No specific delusion or hallucination content was associated with level of anxiety, when other variables were controlled for. The results demonstrate that anxiety and depression are linked to distinct aspects of psychotic experience, highlighting the need to acknowledge the role of these concurrent symptoms in the context of psychosis. In addition, findings relating to specific types of delusions and hallucinations highlight avenues for further research.",

        "a3_doc": "Atypical antipsychotics (APDs) antagonize both serotonin and dopamine receptors. This antagonism is, however, often confounded by co-administration of other medications, such as antidepressants, that affect pharmacological activity at these receptors. While it is known that the modulation of dopamine affects cognitive processes such as working memory, the interactions between APDs and antidepressants in behaviors including sensory processes are not clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of combined treatment with antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics on memory-related visual processing in schizophrenia. We employed (1) contrast detection, a task requiring the maintenance of visual signals over a short period of time; and (2) direction discrimination, a task not requiring maintenance of visual signals. On contrast detection, the performance was significantly worse in the patients taking both APDs and antidepressants than in patients taking just APDs. On direction discrimination, however, the performance did not differ between the patients tasking just APD and those taking both APDs and antidepressants. Given that antidepressants interfere with APD's stimulation of D1 receptors via agonism of serotonin receptors, the poor performance on contrast detection suggests that the interaction between these two types of psychotropic drugs selectively disrupts the sensory processes requiring retention of visual information.",

        "a6_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nMost studies report a poor response of psychotic depressed patients to treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant alone compared to combined treatment with an antipsychotic preparation and compared to non-psychotic depressed patients. However, the issue of optimal treatment of psychotic depressed patients has not been resolved as yet. Previously, we reported a significant difference in response to mirtazapine compared to imipramine in a randomised, double-blind, fixed-blood-level study with in-patients with major depression. In the current study we focus on the treatment response to imipramine in a group of patients with psychotic depression and compare this to patients who manifest no psychotic features. Our aim in presenting these findings was to contribute to the discussion on the optimal treatment of psychotic depressed patients.\nMETHODS\n\n\nFifty-two patients with a unipolar major depression (DSM-IIIR), comprising 15 patients with mood-congruent psychotic features and 37 patients with no psychotic features, were commenced on treatment with imipramine after a drug-free and placebo-washout period of 7 days. The dose of imipramine was adjusted for all patients to a predetermined blood level. The Hamilton (HRSD) and Montgomery-Asberg (MADRS) Depression Rating Scales were used to evaluate treatment response.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf the 45 patients who completed the study, nine of the 13 psychotic patients (69.2%) and 14 of the 32 non-psychotic patients (43.8%) responded to treatment. The patients with psychotic features demonstrated a lower mean final HRSD score, together with a greater fall in MADRS score over time, compared to the non-psychotic group. Both these findings remained statistically significant after controlling for a number of possible confounding factors.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThese results demonstrate that, in this group of patients with mood-congruent psychotic depression, imipramine used on its own together with strict control of serum drug levels produced a high treatment response rate of 70%.\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nIf replicated, these findings suggest that imipramine with control of blood levels of medication may be a useful first-line treatment for depressed patients with mood-congruent psychotic features.\nLIMITATIONS\n\n\nOur sample size was modest. This fact may caution against generalisation of the results.",

        "a7_doc": "AIM\n\n\nUp to half of patients with borderline personality disorder report auditory verbal hallucinations that are phenomenologically indistinguishable from those in schizophrenia, occur early in the course of the disorder, and are enduring, distressing and disabling. In clinical practice, this symptom is widely assumed to be unresponsive to treatment with antipsychotic medication and early intervention is rarely offered. The Verbal Experiences Response in Borderline personality disorder to Aripiprazole TrIal Medication (VERBATIM) study aims to be the first controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of conventional pharmacotherapy for this symptom in this patient group.\nMETHOD\n\n\nVERBATIM is a 12-week, triple-blind, single-centre, parallel groups randomised controlled trial, with a 27-week follow-up period. Participants between the ages of 15 and 25 years receive either aripiprazole or placebo daily, commencing at 2 mg and increasing to 10 mg by day 15. Further dose escalations (up to 30 mg) may occur, as clinically indicated. This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12616001192471 on 30/08/2016.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe primary outcome is severity of auditory verbal hallucinations assessed using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes include the severity of general psychopathology, borderline personality pathology, social and occupational functioning and change in brain resting state connectivity. The primary endpoint is week 12 and secondary endpoint is week 39.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe results will inform treatment decisions for individuals with borderline personality disorder who present with auditory verbal hallucinations.",

We assessed the extent to which the pharmacotherapy received by patients with MD-Psy under usual care conforms to these recommendations.\nMETHOD\n\n\nWe assessed the pharmacotherapy received under usual care conditions by 100 patients with MD-Psy prior to enrollment in STOP-PD (Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression), a 12-week randomized, controlled trial comparing olanzapine plus sertraline to olanzapine plus placebo. Our assessment took place from January 2003 to May 2004. The strength of antidepressant trials was rated using the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF). The strength of antipsychotic trials or combinations of antidepressants and antipsychotics was rated using a modified version of the ATHF. We also determined whether the strength of antipsychotic or combination trials was associated with age, the duration of the current depressive episode, medical burden, cognitive status, or the severity of depressive or psychotic symptoms.\nRESULTS\n\n\nMost patients with MD-Psy were treated with antidepressants (N = 82, 82%) or antipsychotics (N = 65, 65%). About half of the patients (N = 48, 48%) received therapeutic doses of an antidepressant; 10% (N = 10) received an intermediate dose of an antipsychotic, and 6% (N = 6) received a high dose. Overall, only 5% (N = 5) received a combination of an adequate dose of an antidepressant and a high dose of an antipsychotic. The strength of both antipsychotic trials (p = .021) and combination trials (p = .039) was significantly associated only with a longer duration of the current depressive episode.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThese findings show a persisting low use of antipsychotics in the treatment of MD-Psy. Given the high morbidity rates associated with MD-Psy, it is important to continue to educate clinicians regarding its identification and treatment.\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00056472.",

The primary efficacy outcome was the frequency of complete response at week 24. Thereafter, patients who met either complete or partial response criteria continued blinded treatment through week 52. During this phase of the study, subjects in the abatacept treatment group in whom a complete response was achieved at week 24 discontinued immunosuppressive therapy other than prednisone (10 mg/day).\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to the primary outcome or any of the secondary outcomes, including measures of safety. A complete response was achieved in 33% of the subjects in the treatment group and in 31% of the subjects in the control group at week 24.

We aimed to identify practice patterns in antihyperglycemic therapy during the insulin transition, and determine factors associated with metformin continuation.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial which randomized overweight/obese adults under ambulatory care for type 2 diabetes to an intensive lifestyle intervention or diabetes support and education. Among the 931 participants who initiated insulin over ten years, we described longitudinal changes in antihyperglycemic medications during the insulin transition, and performed multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association between patient characteristics and metformin continuation.\nRESULTS\n\n\nBefore insulin initiation, 81.0% of patients used multiple antihyperglycemics, the most common being metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. After insulin initiation, metformin was continued in 80.3% of patients; other antihyperglycemics were continued less often, yet 58.0% of patients were treated with multiple non-insulin antihyperglycemics. Metformin continuation was inversely associated with age (fully adjusted (a) OR 0.60 per 10\u202fyears [0.42-0.86]), serum creatinine above safety thresholds (aOR 0.09 [0.02-0.36]), lower income (P\u202f=\u202f0.025 for trend), taking more medications (aOR 0.92 per medication [0.86-0.98]), and initiating rapid, short, or premixed insulin (aOR 0.59 [0.39-0.89]).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes continue metformin after insulin initiation, consistent with guidelines.

A total of 49 patients (aged 53 +/- 8 years, with BMI 34 +/- 4 kg/m2, A1C 8.1 +/- 1.1%, and duration of diabetes 11 +/- 7 years) were randomized to either substitute exenatide for insulin or remain on their current insulin regimen. Patients who either completed > or = 8 weeks of study or discontinued because of loss of glycemic control were included in primary efficacy analysis.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 62% (18 of 29) of the exenatide-treated patients maintained glycemic control compared with 81% (13 of 16) of the insulin-treated patients. Of the 11 exenatide-treated patients who did not maintain control, 5 discontinued before week 16 because of loss of glucose control. The overall safety profile was generally consistent with previous exenatide trials. The mean overall hypoglycemia rates were 1.72 and 0.97 events/patient-year for the exenatide and insulin reference groups, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThis pilot study suggests that it is feasible to sustain glycemic control when substituting exenatide for insulin. Although it is not possible to characterize clear predictors of outcome given the size and exploratory nature of the study, the data suggest that patients with longer disease duration, who are taking higher doses of insulin and have less endogenous beta-cell function, may experience deterioration in glucose control if exenatide is substituted for insulin therapy.",

Metformin should be discontinued if cardiac, hepatic or renal failure develops. We examined whether glycaemic control can be maintained after metformin cessation.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe included 45 type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin plus metformin, and 45 matched controls treated with insulin only. After discontinuation of metformin in the first group, we aimed for tight fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, 4-7 and 4-10 mmol/l, respectively, in both groups. During 12 weeks we assessed glycaemic control every two weeks and, if necessary, adjusted the insulin dosage.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn the group in which metformin was discontinued, DDI increased from 67.9 +/- 22.9 to 92.2 +/- 29.4 IU (p < 0.001) leaving glycaemic control unchanged. In the controls, glycated haemoglobin (GHb) decreased by 0.93% (p < 0.001), while DDI increased slightly from 62.4 +/- 22.9 to 72.3 +/- 27.3 IU (p < 0.001). The increase in DDI was larger in patients in whom metformin was discontinued than in the controls (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin plus metformin, glycaemic control can be maintained after discontinuation of metformin by increasing the DDI substantially (20 to 36%) during application of an intensified treatment protocol.",

Glycemic control, defined as >50% capillary blood glucose within target range, was compared between groups. Other outcomes included patient tolerance, neonatal and obstetric complications, maternal weight gain, neonatal cord blood C-peptide, and patient satisfaction with therapy.\nRESULTS\n\n\nTwenty-eight women completed the study, with 14 in each group. Of the 15 women assigned to metformin, 100% continued to receive metformin until delivery, although 43% required supplemental insulin to achieve glycemic control. Glucose measures did not differ between the groups, and the proportion who met fasting and postprandial glycemic target values did not differ between the groups.

The primary outcome was glycemic control measured with hemoglobin A1c\u2009<\u20097% at delivery. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between groups.\nRESULTS\n\n\nIn this study, 8 women received metformin and 11 received insulin. All women in both groups achieved glycemic control by delivery (HgbA1c: metformin 5.96\u2009\u00b1\u20095.88 vs. insulin 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92%). There were similar rates of cesarean delivery, birth weights, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal dextrose treatment between groups. There was one case of fetal macrosomia in the insulin group, one case of shoulder dystocia in the metformin group and no cases of failed metformin therapy.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIn this pilot study, glycemic control was achieved in women who received metformin and insulin.

        "a9_doc": "Type 2 diabetes is a common disorder often accompanied by numerous metabolic abnormalities leading to a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from the UKPDS have confirmed that intensive glucose control delays the onset and retards the progression of microvascular disease and possibly of macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the early stages of the disease, insulin resistance plays a major role in the development of hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities, and patients with type 2 diabetes often benefit from measures to improve insulin sensitivity such as weight loss, dietary changes, and exercise. Later, the use of oral insulin secretagogues and insulin sensitizers as monotherapy and in combination helps maintain glycemia for varying periods of time. Ultimately, because of the progressive nature of the disease and the progressive decline in pancreatic beta-cell function, insulin therapy is almost always obligatory to achieve optimal glycemic goals. Not all patients are candidates for aggressive insulin management; therefore, the goals of therapy should be modified, especially in elderly individuals and those with co-morbid conditions. Candidates for intensive management should be motivated, compliant, and educable, without other major medical conditions and physical limitations that would preclude accurate and reliable HGM and insulin administration. In selected patients, combination therapy with insulin and oral antidiabetic medications can be an effective method for normalizing glycemia without the need for rigorous multiple-injection regimens. The patients for whom combination therapy is most commonly successful are those who do not achieve adequate glycemic control using daytime oral agents but who still show some evidence of responsiveness to the medications. Bedtime intermediate-acting or predinner premixed intermediate- and rapid-acting insulin is administered and progressively increased until the FPG concentration is normalized. If combination therapy is not successful, a split-mixed regimen of intermediate- and rapid-acting insulin equally divided between the prebreakfast and pre-dinner periods is advised for oese patients, and more intensive regimens are advised for thin patients. Insulin therapy is invariably associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia. The use of metformin or glitazones in combination with insulin has been demonstrated to have insulin-sparing properties. Also, metformin use may ameliorate weight gain. The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps can be particularly beneficial in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not respond satisfactorily to more conventional treatment strategies. Intraperitoneal insulin delivery systems hold considerable promise in type 2 diabetes because of their more physiologic delivery of insulin and their ability to inhibit hepatic glucose production selectively, with less peripheral insulinemia than with subcutaneous insulin injections. Newer insulin analogues such as the rapidly acting Lispro insulin and the peakless, long-acting glargine insulin are increasingly being used because of their unique physiologic pharmacokinetics. New developments such as inhaled and buccal insulin preparations will also make it easier for many patients to initiate and maintain a proper insulin regimen. Finally, a new generation of gut peptides such as amylin and GLP-1 will add a new dimension to glycemic control through modification of nutrient delivery and other mechanisms; however, the ultimate goal in the management of type 2 diabetes is the primary prevention of the disease. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health has currently randomly assigned more than 3000 persons with impaired glucose tolerance and at high risk of developing diabetes into three treatment arms: metformin arm, an intensive lifestyle-modification arm, and a placebo arm. The study will conclude in 2002 after all participants have been followed for 3 to 6 years.",

At 6 years, patients allocated to insulin had lower fasting plasma glucose levels than did patients allocated to oral agents, but hemoglobin A1c concentrations were similar. Forty-eight percent (95% CI, 37% to 58%) of patients in the primary diet failure group maintained hemoglobin A1c concentrations less than 0.08. By 6 years, 51% of patients (CI, 42% to 62%) allocated to ultralente insulin required additional short-acting insulin and 66% of patients (CI, 58% to 73%) allocated to sulfonylurea required additional therapy with metformin or insulin to control symptoms and maintain fasting plasma glucose levels less than 15 mmol/L. Patients allocated to insulin gained more weight and had more hypoglycemic attacks than did patients allocated to sulfonylurea. Obese patients allocated to metformin gained the least weight and had the fewest hypoglycemic attacks. For all therapies, control achieved at 6 years was worse in the primary diet failure group than in the diet-controlled group.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nBecause initial insulin therapy induced more hypoglycemic reactions and weight gain without necessarily providing better control, it may be reasonable to start with oral agents and change to insulin if goals for glycemic levels are not achieved.",
