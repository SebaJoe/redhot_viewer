The objectives of these post hoc analyses of the global Phase III 093-0304 trial (NCT00988429, Study 304) of adjunctive eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in patients with refractory focal (partial-onset) seizures (FS) were to evaluate associations between seizure severity change, measured by the Seizure Severity Questionnaire (SSQ), and 1) patient characteristics, 2) seizure frequency change, standardized as the seizure frequency (SSF) per 28-day period, and 3) change in HRQoL, evaluated by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) and the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The analyses were conducted on the per-protocol population (PPP) of patients who were randomized to a placebo arm (n\u202f=\u202f188) or an ESL-active group that included treatment with adjunctive ESL 800\u202fmg once daily (QD; n\u202f=\u202f184) or adjunctive ESL 1200\u202fmg QD (n\u202f=\u202f175). General linear models (GLM) were used to measure the association between SSQ change and patient baseline characteristics or percentage change in the SSF from baseline. Associations between changes in the SSQ and changes in the QOLIE-31 and MADRS were examined using GLM with patient baseline characteristics as covariates. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients in the ESL-active group and those treated with ESL 800\u202fmg or ESL 1200\u202fmg. Minimal clinically important difference (MCIDs) thresholds were used to assess improvements in SSQ scores. The analyses included 547 per-protocol patients. Patients using 1 antiepileptic drug (AED) at baseline had greater improvements in the SSQ compared with those receiving 2 AEDs (P\u202f=\u202f0.0606). Treatment with ESL 1200\u202fmg was significantly associated with clinically meaningful improvements in the SSQ (P\u202f=\u202f0.0005). The SSQ improvements were significantly associated with an SSF reduction of \u226575%, compared with no reduction (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001). In the PPP and the ESL-active group, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 Total Score (TS; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the Seizure Worry (SW; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Social Functioning (SF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0030) subscales. In the ESL 1200\u202fmg subgroup, SSQ improvements were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and the SW (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and Energy\/Fatigue (EF; P\u202f=\u202f0.0007) subscales. In the ESL 800\u202fmg subgroup, improvements in the SSQ were significantly associated with improvements in QOLIE-31 TS (P\u202f=\u202f0.0362) and the SW (P\u202f=\u202f0.0241) subscale. There was no significant association between changes in the SSQ and changes in the MADRS in patients treated with ESL. These findings demonstrated that in this clinical trial population, adding ESL to baseline AED therapy had utility for decreasing seizure severity and improving HRQoL. There were no significant associations between changes in seizure severity and changes in depressive symptoms in patients with FS.","t2":"Comparative bioavailability of carbamazepine from two slow-release preparations.","p2":"There were more epileptic seizures on Tegretol Retard than on Neurotol slow, but the difference was not statistically significant.","a2_doc":"In order to compare the multiple-dose bioavailability of carbamazepine (CBZ) from 2 slow-release preparations, Neurotol slow and Tegretol Retard, a single-blind, randomized, cross-over study was carried out. 21 adult patients with epilepsy were enrolled in the study. At the end of both 2-week treatment periods, a blood sample series was drawn after the administration of the morning CBZ dose. The serum concentrations of CBZ, CBZ-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxy-CBZ (CBZD) were measured using HPLC. The mean bioavailability of CBZ from Neurotol slow was 11% (P = 0.002) higher than from Tegretol Retard. Owing to the better bioavailability, the peak (Cmax), lowest (Cmin) and mean (Css) concentrations of CBZ were also significantly higher during Neurotol slow treatment. Fluctuation of serum CBZ concentrations (Cmax-Cmin\/Css, ADCss\/AUC0-12h) did not differ significantly between the 2 treatments; neither did tmax. Similar results were obtained with CBZE and CBZD. There were more epileptic seizures on Tegretol Retard than on Neurotol slow, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that there are significant differences in the bioavailability of CBZ from these 2 slow-release preparations.","t3":"Bioavailability of two carbamazepine preparations during chronic administration to epileptic patients.","p3":"There was no difference in absorption or steady-state level between the two preparations.","a3_doc":"Two preparations of carbamazepine, as tablets and in syrup, were given for 8 weeks to 20 patients with epilepsy in a randomized crossover study. Weekly plasma levels were 3-21 mg\/1 on dosages of 5-24 mg\/kg\/day. There was no difference in absorption or steady-state level between the two preparations. Carbamazepine 10, 11-oxide was constantly present when the level of carbamazepine was over 5 mg\/l, and tended to be lower with the syrup.","t4":"Evaluation of the effects of vigabatrin on cognitive abilities and quality of life in epilepsy.","p4":"At the end of the study, there were no differences between the vigabatrin and placebo groups on any cognitive variable or on any measure of mood and adjustment.","a4_doc":"We evaluated the psychological effects of the antiepilepsy drug vigabatrin in a randomized multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group study that compared 3 grams oral vigabatrin with placebo as daily add-on therapy in patients with focal epilepsy whose complex partial seizures were difficult to control. Testing at baseline and after 12 weeks of vigabatrin (n = 83) or placebo (n = 85) used eight measures of cognitive abilities and three of mood and adjustment. The vigabatrin and placebo groups were highly similar at entry into the study. At the end of the study, there were no differences between the vigabatrin and placebo groups on any cognitive variable or on any measure of mood and adjustment. Analysis of the results related to relief from seizures demonstrated only chance findings. In a similar manner, there were no relationships between vigabatrin serum levels at the end of the study and changes on measures of abilities and adjustment. Vigabatrin appears to be a useful antiepilepsy drug with little impact upon tests of either cognitive abilities or quality of life.","t5":"Therapeutic bioequivalency study of brand name versus generic carbamazepine.","p5":"Average seizure frequencies were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p less than 0.05).","a5_doc":"We performed a randomized double-blind crossover therapeutic bioequivalency study of a generic (Epitol) versus a brand name (Tegretol) carbamazepine product under steady-state conditions in 40 epileptic patients. Each patient received 90-day supplies of Epitol or Tegretol and placebo, which replaced the usual dosage of the alternate product. Group A consisted of 20 seizure-free (from 5 months to 2 years) patients and group B of 20 patients with seizures refractory to drug therapy. In group A, four patients had seizures, two on both Epitol and Tegretol and two on Tegretol. In group B, the average seizure frequencies were 0.25 seizures per day on Epitol and 0.22 seizures per day on Tegretol. Average seizure frequencies were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p less than 0.05). Areas under the curve were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p = 0.05). Average peak heights were statistically the same (at a 20% difference, p less than 0.05). Average time to peak was earlier with Epitol. Epitol and Tegretol performed equally well in clinical efficacy and bioequivalency.","t6":"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of ganaxolone as add-on therapy in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures.","p6":"From baseline to endpoint, mean weekly seizure frequency decreased with ganaxolone (6.5-5.2) versus placebo (9.2-10.8), representing an 11.4% decrease versus placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0489, analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]).","a6_doc":"OBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures despite taking up to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).\nMETHODS\n\n\nAdults aged 18-69\u00a0years and refractory to conventional AEDs were enrolled in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After an 8-week baseline period, patients were randomized 2:1 to ganaxolone 1,500\u00a0mg\/day or placebo for a 10-week treatment period (2-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance) followed by either tapering or entry into an open-label extension study. The primary endpoint was mean weekly seizure frequency. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients experiencing \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency (responder rate), percent change in mean weekly seizure frequency, seizure-free days, and quality of life. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuation, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 147 randomized patients (98 ganaxolone, 49 placebo), 131 completed the study; 95% of participants titrated up to 1,500\u00a0mg\/day and 78% maintained this dose.

Mean percent change from baseline was -17.6% with ganaxolone versus 2.0% with placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0144, Kruskal-Wallis test). Responder rates were 24% with ganaxolone versus 15% with placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19). Discontinuation due to adverse events was similar with ganaxolone (7.1%) and placebo (6.1%). Common adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and included dizziness (16.3% vs. 8.2%), fatigue (16.3% vs. 8.2%), and somnolence (13.3% vs. 2.0%).\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nGanaxolone 1,500\u00a0mg\/day reduced partial-onset seizure frequency and was generally safe and well tolerated in this phase 2 study.

Ethanol in doses of 25 mL in 150 mL of grapefruit juice (total volume) or grapefruit juice was randomly administered 10 minutes before and at 30 minutes of a 60-minute treadmill run. The speed and grade of the treadmill was adjusted to elicit an average oxygen consumption (VO2) of 80 to 85% of the subjects' VO2max. Three of the four subjects could not complete the treadmill run after the administration of ethanol. Administration of ethanol resulted in significant increases in the heart rate responses to treadmill running above those for the placebo grapefruit treatment. VO2 was higher after ethanol administration than the placebo grapefruit juice treatment, but these values were not significant. Blood glucose content rose significantly between 0 and 30 minutes of treadmill running for both the ethanol and placebo grapefruit juice treatments. Between 30 minutes of treadmill running and the termination of the exercise, the blood glucose level decreased significantly by 24% after the second ethanol treatment at 30 minutes of exercise. Plasma fatty acid, triglyceride, creatine phosphokinase, and renin contents followed expected exercise changes. It was concluded that the administration of ethanol adversely influenced treadmill exercise performance by eliciting a hypoglycemic effect between 30 minutes and the termination of the exercise.","t8":"Efficacy, tolerability, and safety of rapid initiation of topiramate versus phenytoin in patients with new-onset epilepsy: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.","p8":"A post hoc analysis showed that TPM was superior to PHT in time to discontinuation (retention rate) for all causes (89.4% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.047).\n","a8_doc":"PURPOSE\n\n\nTo evaluate topiramate (TPM) and phenytoin (PHT) monotherapy following rapid oral initiation in new-onset epilepsy.\nMETHODS\n\n\nRandomized, double-blind, 28-day trial of TPM (100 mg\/day beginning on day 1) versus PHT (1,000 mg on day 1 followed by 300 mg\/day maintenance dosing) in 261 patients with new-onset epilepsy. The primary end point was time to seizure, and the primary objective was to establish noninferiority of TPM to PHT in the risk of seizure.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt day 28, the estimated seizure-free rate was 81.1% for TPM treatment in comparison with 90.3% for PHT treatment. Noninferiority of TPM to PHT (primary objective) could not be established [hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98 to 4.12, p = 0.366), and PHT could not be shown to be superior to TPM. A higher percentage discontinued with PHT compared to TPM for all reasons (21.1 vs. 12.8%) and due to adverse events (13.4 vs. 6.8%). The most common treatment-related adverse events in both groups were dizziness, paresthesia, and somnolence. A post hoc analysis showed that TPM was superior to PHT in time to discontinuation (retention rate) for all causes (89.4% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study was inconclusive in establishing noninferiority of TPM 100 mg\/day compared to a standard regimen of oral PHT in seizure risk in this population of patients with new-onset epilepsy. Given the superiority of TPM in overall retention and favorable tolerability without titration, it may nonetheless be an appropriate option in some patients with new-onset epilepsy requiring rapid treatment initiation.","t9":"The influence of established and new antiepileptic drugs on visual perception. 1. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose study in healthy volunteers.","p9":"After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile.","a9_doc":"The influence of single oral dosages of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid, vigabatrin (VGB), lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), and losigamone (LSG) on visual perception was investigated in ten healthy volunteers according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. The test battery comprised visual acuity, the Lanthony-D-15-d\u00e9satur\u00e9 colour perception test, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia threshold measurements, perception threshold assessment for monochromatic and chromatic gaussian dots, monochromatic gratings and gratings of differing spatial frequency, and critical flicker fusion tests with various stimuli. The only consistent and partly significant effects were seen after VGB and GBP. After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile. The other tests were not influenced consistently by any antiepileptic drug (AED). We conclude that: (i) gamma-amino-butyric acid-(GABA)-related properties as under the prototype drug VGB result in specific alterations of the transient tritanopia phenomenon which is consistent with the physiological hypothesis for this retinal paradigm based on extracellular recordings in primates. The possible mechanisms why VGB improved critical flicker fusion as the only AED in this trial are discussed. The profile of GBP indicates a unique mechanism of action. We have not observed specific influences on visual perception under AEDs which act mainly via alterations of ion membrane conductance. The transient tritanopia and flicker fusion paradigms we used appear to be promising to investigate antiepileptic drugs with hitherto unknown modes of actions in human noninvasively.","t10":"Efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam in adults with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures: a phase IIb, randomized, controlled trial.","p10":"During the treatment period, this was 34.9% for BRV50 (p = 0.004) and 28.3% for BRV150 (p = 0.070) compared with 16.3% for placebo.","a10_doc":"PURPOSE\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV), a novel high-affinity synaptic vesicle protein 2A ligand that also displays inhibitory activity at neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels, in adult epilepsy patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA phase IIb, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study (N01114; NCT00175929) was conducted in patients aged 16-65 years. To be included in the study, patients were required to have experienced four or more partial-onset seizures during a 4-week prospective baseline, despite treatment with 1-2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive BRV 50 mg\/day (BRV50), 150 mg\/day (BRV150), or placebo.

Nine patients were free from partial-onset seizures during the 10-week treatment period (five patients [9.4%] in the BRV50 group and three [5.8%] in the BRV150 group compared with one patient [1.9%] in the placebo group). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported during the treatment period were mostly mild-to-moderate with similar incidence across treatment groups (BRV50 36\/53, 67.9%; BRV150 35\/52, 67.3%; placebo 37\/52, 71.2%).

Safety outcomes were frequency and severity of solicited injection site and systemic reactions within 7 days after booster vaccination as well as frequency and severity of any unsolicited adverse events (AE) after up to 6 months. Immunogenicity outcomes were the immune response to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 assessed 14 days post booster expressed as geometric mean titres (GMT), GMT fold ratios and seroconversion of specific neutralizing antibodies and S-protein binding IgG antibodies. Immunogenicity against the Delta and Omicron VoCs was assessed as a post-hoc outcome with a pseudovirus neutralization antibody assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04864561, and is ongoing.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was administered to 958 participants, of whom 712 had been primed with VLA2001, and 246 with ChAdOx1-S. Within 7 days following these booster doses, 607 (63.4%) participants reported solicited injection site reactions, and 487 (50.8%) reported solicited systemic reactions. Up to 14 days post booster, 751 (78.4%) participants reported at least one adverse event. The tolerability profile of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar in VLA2001-primed and ChAdOx1-S-primed participants. In VLA2001-primed participants, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 32.5 (22.8, 46.3) immediately before to 521.5 (413.0, 658.6) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, this corresponds to a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 27.7 (20.0, 38.5). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 3.6 (2.8, 4.7). In the ChAdOx1-S primed group, the GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies increased from 65.8 (43.9, 98.4) immediately before to 188.3 (140.3, 252.8) 2 weeks after administration of the booster dose, a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 3.0 (2.2, 4.0). Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMFR was 1.6 (1.1, 2.2). For S-protein binding IgG antibodies, the pre- versus post-booster GMT fold ratio (95% CI) was 34.6 (25.0, 48.0) in the VLA2001-primed group and 4.0 (3.0, 5.2) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. Compared to 2 weeks after the second priming dose, the GMT fold rise of IgG antibodies was 3.8 (3.2, 4.6) in the VLA2001-primed group and 1.2 (0.9, 1.6) in the ChAdOx1-S-primed group. The GMT against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.4\/5) increased from 4.2 to 260, and from 2.7 to 56.7, respectively, when boosting subjects previously primed with VLA2001. Following the boost, 97% of subjects primed with VLA2001 had detectable Delta- and 94% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S, the GMT against Delta and Omicron titres increased from 9.1 to 92.5, and from 3.6 to 12.3, respectively. After boosting, 99% of subjects primed with ChAdOx1-S had detectable Delta- and 70% Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. In both VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S primed subjects, the additional VLA2001 dose boosted T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens to levels above those observed before the booster dose.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nA booster dose of VLA2001 was safe and well tolerated after primary immunization with VLA2001 and ChAdOx1-S. The tolerability of a booster dose of VLA2001 was similar to the favourable profile observed after the first and second priming doses. Both in a homologous and a heterologous setting, boosting resulted in higher neutralizing antibody titres than after primary immunization and significant increases in cross-neutralization titres against Delta and Omicron were observed after the booster dose. These data support the use of VLA2001 in booster programmes in ChadOx1-S primed groups.","t5":"Efficacy of interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised adults with COVID-19: a double-bind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.","p5":"The Kaplan-Meier estimate of mortality at 28 days was 5% (95% CI 3-7%) in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group and 3% (2-6%) in the placebo plus remdesivir group (hazard ratio 1\u00b733","a5_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nFunctional impairment of interferon, a natural antiviral component of the immune system, is associated with the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19.

Although the use of antibiotics is widely documented, the interest of short cycles of corticosteroids in the treatment of the functional manifestations of AMRS is based on professional experience. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerance to prednisone administered for 3 days in addition to antibiotherapy in patients presenting with an AMRS.\nMETHOD\n\n\nThis was a double blind, randomised study in parallel groups and controlled versus a placebo, involving patients aged over 18, presenting with an AMRS confirmed by X-ray and endoscopy, having developed less than 5 days and complaining of spontaneous pain assessed as >or=50 millimetres on a visual analog scale (VAS). Together with cefpodoxime, the patients received either prednisone (0.8 to 1.2 mg\/kg) for 3 days or a placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean of the differences versus the baseline value of pain (MPID - mean pain intensity difference) assessed on the VAS from Day 1 to Day 3. The secondary endpoints assessed were the mean of the differences in intensity of nasal obstruction, assessed in the same way as the MPID, the time lapse before the orally expressed relief of the pain (PRID - pain reflief intensity difference) and the administration of paracetamol during the first 3 days.\nRESULTS\n\n\n289 patients (placebo 147, prednisone 142) were assessable for analysis in intent-to-treat (ITT). The global spontaneous pain on inclusion, measured by a VAS was of 73.0 +\/- 14.1 mm. The assessments made during the first 3 days of treatment showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the prednisone group regarding MPID: - 4.82 mm (CI 95% -9.25; -0.40) (p=0.03), nasal obstruction - 5.0 mm (CI 95% -9.1; -0.8) (p=0.02) and consumption of paracetamol (p=0.03). There was no difference between the two groups after the end of the antibiotherapy. The tolerance measured throughout the study was comparable between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study clearly showed the efficacy of a short course of oral prednisone (3 days), versus a placebo, in the treatment of the functional signs of acute maxillary rhinosinusitis with severe pain in adults in addition to an appropriate antibiotic treatment.","t6":"Relative importance of antibiotic and improved clearance in topical treatment of chronic mucopurulent rhinosinusitis.

The effect of acupuncture cannot be assessed by optical rhinometry (ORM).\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nIn most cases nasal congestion is caused by hypertrophy of the inferior turbinate as a result of allergic and chronic rhinitis. Topical decongestants cause severe side effects. As a consequence, there is an increasing demand for alternative treatment options such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).\nMETHODS\n\n\nA total of 25 patients with nasal congestion due to hypertrophic inferior turbinate were recruited. The mucosal swelling status of the inferior turbinate was assessed by continuous ORM for 20 min. Patients were asked to score the severity of their nasal congestion on a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and 10 and 20 min after acupuncture. Specific verum acupuncture points related to nasal congestion were tested against non-specific control sham acupuncture points.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSham acupuncture improved VAS scores, whereas ORM measured an increase in nasal swelling. The ORM revealed a quicker onset of the effect of verum acupuncture on the nasal blood flow. Also, verum acupuncture reaches its maximum effect in a shorter time period, so that the net reaction time was much shorter. However, ORM could not prove a decongestant effect of verum acupuncture on inferior turbinate.","t9":"Efficacy of Povidone-Iodine Nasal Irrigation Solution After Sinonasal Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Study.","p9":"However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in TWSNOT-22, endoscopic, or TNR scores 3\u2009months after the operation (all, P\u2009>\u2009.05).\n","a9_doc":"OBJECTIVES\/HYPOTHESIS\n\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of postoperative nasal irrigation with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solution in patients undergoing sinonasal surgery.\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\n\nSingle-blind, randomized controlled study.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis is a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled study.

I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.\n\nFrom the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and\/or severity: \n\nSaccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u00a0CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum\u00a0MIMBb75.\n\nI may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).\n\nAlso, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data\/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.\n\nBifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).\n\nA lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.\n\nIt's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.\n\nAlso, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and\/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract\/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.\n\nAnd of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor.

The prebiotic UG1601 consists of inulin, lactitol, and aloe vera gel, which are known laxatives, but randomized, controlled clinical trials that examine the effects of this supplement on gut microbiota composition are lacking.\nAIM\n\n\nTo assess the efficacy of the prebiotic UG1601 in suppressing constipation-related adverse events in subjects with mild constipation.\nMETHODS\n\n\nAdults with a stool frequency of less than thrice a week were randomized to receive either prebiotics or a placebo supplement for 4 wk. All participants provided their fecal and blood samples at baseline and at the end of intervention. Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool frequency were evaluated. The concentrations of serum endotoxemia markers and fecal SCFAs were determined. The relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and the gut microbial community in the responders and non-responders in the prebiotics supplementation group were evaluated.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms between groups, although the prebiotic group showed greater symptom improvement. However, after prebiotic usage, serum cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were significantly decreased (CD14,  P  = 0.012; LPS,  P  < 0.001). The change in LPS concentration was significantly larger in the prebiotic group than in the placebo group ( P  < 0.001). Fecal SCFAs concentrations did not differ between groups, while the relative abundance of  Roseburia hominis , a major butyrate producer, was significantly increased in the prebiotic group ( P  = 0.045). The abundances of the phylum Firmicutes and the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia) ( P  = 0.009) were decreased in the responders within the prebiotic group. In addition, the proportions of the phylum Firmicutes, the class Clostridia, and the order Clostridiales were inversely correlated with several fecal SCFAs ( P  < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAlterations in gut microbiota composition, including a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria, following prebiotic UG1601 supplementation might help alleviate symptom scores and endotoxemia.","t10":"Effect of Lactocare\u00ae Synbiotic on Disease Severity in Ulcerative Colitis: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind Clinical Trial.","p10":"Response to treatment was observed in 90.9% of patients with ulcerative colitis for more than 5 years compared with 44.4% of the control group ( p  = 0.01).","a10_doc":"BACKGROUND Inflammatory bowel diseases are managed by different methods, which may not be well tolerated because of their side effects. Recently, pro-prebiotics are considered as a supplementary treatment in gastrointestinal diseases. In this study, the effect of Lactocare\u00ae (ZistTakhmir Company) was investigated on the disease severity in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. METHODS In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial (Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials number: IRCT201407271264N5), 60 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis were included. An 8-week trial was carried out comparing Lactocare\u00ae as a supplement with standard therapy against placebo. Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) was measured at baseline and after 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using paired ttest to assess the temporal changes (before and after the treatment) in the mean of SCCAI in each group. Chi-square test was used to compare the response rates. Odds ratios (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were also calculated. p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS A significant decreased mean SCCAI was seen in the intervention group (4.56 \u00b1 2.56) vs. placebo group (6.54 \u00b1 2.47) ( p  < 0.05). Response to treatment was seen in 64.3% of the treatment group vs. 47% in the placebo group ( p  = 0.18). Response to treatment was observed in 90.9% of patients with ulcerative colitis for more than 5 years compared with 44.4% of the control group ( p  = 0.01). CONCLUSION Regarding the effectiveness of pre-probiotics in mitigating symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis, it could be suggested to try pre-probiotics in the standard treatment particularly in those with more than five years ofthe disease.","subreddit_id":"t5_2s3g1","post_id":"sv1zw9","stage2_labels":"[{\"crowd-entity-annotation\":{\"entities\":[{\"endOffset\":23,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":13},{\"endOffset\":31,\"label\":\"population\",\"startOffset\":28},{\"endOffset\":476,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":453},{\"endOffset\":530,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":508},{\"endOffset\":562,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":538},{\"endOffset\":589,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":564},{\"endOffset\":614,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":591},{\"endOffset\":647,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":621},{\"endOffset\":673,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":649},{\"endOffset\":710,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":687},{\"endOffset\":739,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":717},{\"endOffset\":772,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":747},{\"endOffset\":801,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":778},{\"endOffset\":836,\"label\":\"intervention\",\"startOffset\":813},{\"endOffset\":3214,\"label\":\"population\",\"startOffset\":3211}]}}]","text":"Some Info on Probiotics for IBS\nSo I posted this in a comment and it was suggested that I make this info its own post. I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.\n\nFrom the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and\/or severity: \n\nSaccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u00a0CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum\u00a0MIMBb75.\n\nI may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).\n\nAlso, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data\/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.\n\nBifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).\n\nA lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.\n\nIt's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.\n\nAlso, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and\/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract\/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.\n\nAnd of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor.

As nonstimulant treatments are often used after stimulants in ADHD, GXR was assessed relative to prior stimulant treatment in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which ATX was included as a reference arm, and in the open-label phase of a randomized-withdrawal study (RWS). Participants were 6-17 years old with ADHD Rating Scale version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) scores \u226532 and Clinical Global Impressions - Severity scores \u22654. RCT participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg\/day), ATX (10-100 mg\/day), or placebo for 10-13 weeks. RWS participants received dose-optimized GXR (1-7 mg\/day) for 13 weeks. Participants' last stimulant medication prior to enrolment, and reasons for stopping this medication, were collected at baseline. Change from baseline ADHD-RS-IV score and the proportion of responders were assessed by prior stimulant exposure. Of 163 RCT and 296 RWS participants who had previously received stimulant treatment, 142 and 224, respectively, had received methylphenidate (MPH); due to the low number of participants and the heterogeneity of non-MPH treatments, we only report data for prior MPH treatment. The most frequent reasons for stopping MPH were lack of effectiveness or side effects. Placebo-adjusted ADHD-RS-IV changes from baseline were significant in participants receiving GXR (prior MPH, -9.8, P<0.001, effect size [ES] 0.85; stimulant-na\u00efve, -7.6, P<0.001, ES 0.65).

Medication efficacy was evaluated using ADHD symptom ratings from adolescent self-report and parent report, along with objective measures of inattention and hyperactivity\/impulsivity during driving performance and neuropsychological tasks. Males and females were largely equivalent in impairment, and medication was similarly effective in reducing symptoms. No interactions were found between sex and medication on any measure of effectiveness or side effects. This finding suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of extended-release stimulant medications is equivalent for male and female adolescents with ADHD.","t7":"Stimulant medication withdrawal during long-term therapy in children with comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic multiple tic disorder.","p7":"There was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction).","a7_doc":"OBJECTIVES\n\n\nIn this study we examined changes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors and motor and vocal tics during withdrawal from long-term maintenance therapy with stimulant medication.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSubjects were 19 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and chronic tic disorder who had received methylphenidate (n = 17) or dextroamphetamine (n = 2) for a minimum of 1 year. Children were switched to placebo under double-blind conditions. Treatment effects were assessed by using direct observations of child behavior in a simulated (clinic-based) classroom and behavior rating scales completed by parents and clinician.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was no change (group data) in the frequency or severity of motor tics or vocal tics during the placebo condition compared with maintenance dose of stimulant medication (ie, no evidence of tic exacerbation while receiving medication or of a withdrawal reaction). There was no evidence of tic exacerbation in the evening as a rebound effect. Treatment with the maintenance dose was also associated with behavioral improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors, indicating continued efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAbrupt withdrawal of stimulant medication in children receiving long-term maintenance therapy does not appear to result in worsening of tic frequency or severity. Nevertheless, these findings do not preclude the possibility of drug withdrawal reactions in susceptible individuals.","t8":"Tolerability of High-Dose Venlafaxine After Switch From Escitalopram in Nonresponding Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.","p8":"The switch of medication led to an increase of ADRs such as reduced salivation (+11%), orthostatic dizziness (+11%), and sweating (+9.8%).","a8_doc":"BACKGROUND\n\n\nWithin a single depressive episode, most patients receive different antidepressants because of an inadequate response to the first-line antidepressant. A commonly used strategy is to switch from a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. However, little is known about the tolerability of this switch with consideration of dose and drug concentration in blood.\nMETHODS\n\n\nAfter 4 weeks of inadequate response to escitalopram (10-20 mg\/d), medication was switched to another 4 weeks of venlafaxine (VF, 150-375 mg\/d) in 234 depressed patients. Serum concentrations, depression severity, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed weekly.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe switch of medication led to an increase of ADRs such as reduced salivation (+11%), orthostatic dizziness (+11%), and sweating (+9.8%). The most frequent ADRs during treatment with VF were reduced salivation (28.6%), sweating (24.6%), and orthostatic dizziness (15.8%). In patients receiving high-dose VF, a significant improvement of depressive symptomatology was observed, and most ADRs decreased during the course of treatment, even in patients above the therapeutic reference range.\nLIMITATIONS\n\n\nPatients and physicians were aware of medication, and there was no direct comparison with the herein presented switch of medication.\nIMPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis study provides important information about the tolerability of a commonly used antidepressant treatment strategy. More detailed information about putative ADRs may help clinicians increase compliance through effective patient education. Because ADRs of VF were associated with the plasma concentration, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide the therapy and manage problems of tolerability.","t9":"Efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for promoting occupational success in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder.","p9":"Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo.","a9_doc":"There has been a lack of research on the third area of impairment noted in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition -\"occupational functioning.\" It is important to understand the impact of common treatments for attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in occupational settings. Twenty individuals with ADHD between ages 16 and 25 participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled evaluation of 40 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in a setting designed to approximate a restaurant workplace with associated, simulated food delivery. Outcome measures included ratings of performance, as well as behavioral productivity. Results indicated that participants completed more workplace tasks when on medication, relative to placebo. Ratings of job application quality, job interview performance, and delivery outcomes were not significantly different on medication versus placebo. These results suggest positive effects of medication in a workplace environment, but also a need for study of additional interventions to support workplace-related behavior and functioning.

This analysis examines the characteristics of adult patients with ADHD in a European (EUR) and non-European (NE) patient population.\nMETHODS\n\n\nBaseline data from the open-label treatment period of a randomized trial of atomoxetine in adult patients with ADHD (N=2017; EUR, n=1217; NE, n=800) were examined. All patients who were enrolled were included in the baseline analyses.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe demographics for patients in the EUR and NE groups were comparable. Patients in the EUR group had a somewhat lower percentage of prior exposure to psychostimulants compared with the NE group (32.7% vs. 38.9%, p=.0049). Scores on the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Investigator Rated: Screening Version with adult ADHD prompts (18-item total, inattentive and hyperactive\/impulsive subscales, and index) were comparable.
