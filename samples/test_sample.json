        "a1_doc": "Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) refers to the backflow of stomach contents into the laryngopharynx. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that LPR is a contributing factor in some cases of hoarseness, vocal fatigue, voice breaks, cough and globus and chronic throat clearing. However, several randomised placebo-controlled trials of proton pump inhibitors in the treatment of LPR have been reported with the majority showing no significant benefit in patient symptom scores over placebo. The aim of this pilot clinical study was to investigate whether any improvement in LPR-related symptoms, using the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), and clinical findings, using the Reflux Finding Score (RFS), could be achieved with treatment with a liquid alginate suspension compared to control (no treatment). Patients presenting with the symptoms of LPR to the Otorhinolaryngology Outpatient Department at the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK were considered eligible if they had an RSI of greater than 10 and an RFS greater than 5 based on a fibreoptic examination of the larynx. A total of 49 patients were randomised into the open, parallel group study; 24 patients were randomised to receive 10 ml liquid alginate suspension (Gaviscon Advance) four times daily after meals and at bedtime, and 25 patients into the control group (no treatment). Patients were assessed pre-treatment and at 2, 4 and 6 months post treatment. Mean (SD) RSI and RFS pre-treatment scores were 23.9 (7.0) and 10.4 (3.6) for the treatment group and 24.6 (7.4) and 10.3 (3.3) for the control group, respectively. Significant differences between treatment and control were observed for RSI at the 2-month (11.2 (7.0) vs. 16.8 (6.4), P=0.005) and 6-month (11.2 (8.1) vs. 18.3 (9.4), P=0.008) assessments and for RFS at the 6-month (7.1 (2.8) vs. 9.5 (3.4), P=0.005) assessment.

        "a2_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nTreatment for laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) is challenging because of delays in recognition and poor responsiveness to proton-pump inhibitor therapy. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of liquid alginate suspension for treating LPRD.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective study comparing 8 weeks of treatment with Alginos Oral Suspension (TTY Biopharm Co. Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) (sodium alginate 1,000\u2009mg three times daily) with a placebo was conducted on patients who fulfilled the criteria of at least one symptom consistent with LPRD, a total reflux symptom index (RSI) score of\u2009>\u200910, and a total reflux finding score (RFS) of\u2009>\u20095. Those with erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, as evidenced through screened transnasal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, were excluded. Efficacy was assessed by RSI, RFS, and ambulatory multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) monitoring.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 80 patients aged 22 to 72 years were enrolled. Compared with baseline, both Alginos (TTY Biopharm Co. Ltd.) and the placebo significantly reduced the total RSI (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and the total number of reflux episodes shown by MII-pH monitoring (P\u2009<\u20090.05) after 8 weeks of treatment. However, liquid alginate suspension was unable to show superiority over the placebo. The incidence of various adverse events from Alginos (TTY Biopharm Co. Ltd.) was relatively low (7.7%) and mild.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis study showed that liquid alginate suspension was well tolerated by LPRD patients. It effectively improved symptoms and reflux numbers but was unable to show superiority over placebo. As observed in previous studies, a great placebo effect was present. The importance of lifestyle modification could not be overlooked.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\n\n\n2. Laryngoscope, 128:2252-2260, 2018.",

From pre- to 2-month posttreatment, the mean RSI significantly decreased (p\u2009=\u20090.001) in alginate and PPI group (p\u2009=\u20090.003). The difference between groups in the RSI change was not significant (95%CI: \u00a0-\u00a04.2-6.7, p\u2009=\u20090.639).

Patients were randomised into two treatment groups for 8\u00a0weeks. Group A received oral pantoprazole (40\u00a0mg, twice a day),and Group B received oral pantoprazole (40\u00a0mg) and oral alginate (500\u00a0mg/10\u00a0ml) twice a day each. Treatment outcome was assessed with RSI and RFS at 4 and 8\u00a0weeks. On follow-ups, both groups showed significant improvement in RSI. At 4\u00a0weeks, significant improvement in RFS was seen in Group B, but not in Group A; both groups showed improvement at 8\u00a0weeks. The improvement was significantly better in Group B RSI and RFS on both follow ups. On analysis of each RSI item at 8\u00a0weeks, choking sensation showed no significant improvement in Group A. All other items showed significant improvement in both groups, with all items except difficulty swallowing and choking sensation showing significantly better improvement in Group B. Analysis of each RFS item at 8\u00a0weeks, showed significant improvement in Group B but not in Group A. The addition of alginate to PPI shows greater definitive improvement in both symptoms and signs of LPRD within a short period of 8\u00a0weeks, compared to PPI monotherapy, making it a feasible treatment option with good results in routine practice in a rural set-up. Adjunctive alginate therapy enhances the resolution of clinical features of LPRD and is thus beneficial in its routine treatment in all populations.",

This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study conducted at 13 GP centres in the UK. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years, who had experienced symptoms of reflux oesophagitis within the previous 24 h, and on two other occasions within the previous week, were recruited into the study. Patients were evaluated at baseline, and then reassessed after two and four weeks of treatment with sodium alginate or placebo, for symptoms of reflux oesophagitis in the previous 24 h. Patients were required to fill out a diary card twice daily, from which frequency and severity of symptoms were assessed, and the percentage of symptom-free days and nights calculated. Of the 100 patients recruited into the study, 98 received medication (safety population; placebo, n = 50; sodium alginate, n = 48) and 94 were eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (placebo, n = 48; sodium alginate, n = 46).

Significantly more patients in the safety population on placebo withdrew from the study (40%) compared with sodium alginate (21%; p = 0.04), due primarily to lack of effect and adverse events. The sodium alginate preparation demonstrated a superior efficacy compared with placebo, which was achieved in a more acceptable volume of medication than a previous standard preparation, Liquid Gaviscon. The reduced dosage volume of the 'new' preparation (Gaviscon Advance) may be expected to improve patient compliance, and thereby increase treatment efficacy.",

A continuous pH probe monitoring of the lower oesophageal third was performed in all the patients before and after 8 days of treatment. Before the trial, sensitive pH monitoring variables of acid reflux (Euler-Byrne index, percentage of total reflux time per 24 h, mean duration and percentage of reflux time during sleep, total number of reflux episodes per 24 h and number of reflux episodes per 2 h post-cibal periods) were abnormal in all the patients tested. The oesophagram revealed a GOR in 13 of the 20 patients; none of the children who underwent an endoscopy had evidence of oesophagitis. Episodes of regurgitation reported by the parents decreased during Gaviscon therapy while no clinical improvement was noticed in the placebo group. No adverse effects were observed. After 8 days of treatment with Gaviscon, results of all the pH monitoring variables were significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced between -35% and -61% of the initial values recorded. In the placebo treated group, the mean values remained little changes (-9.5 to +8.2% of initial values).

Six subjects ingested 500 mL of a liquid meal and received a single dose of 20 mL Liquid Gaviscon or 10 mL Gaviscon Advance on 2 separate visits each and were imaged every 15 min. An alginate raft was observed in the stomach for all subjects and both treatments. The raft was observed to consist of a few large fragments on the majority of the scans for both products. At t = 60 min a raft was still present in all cases. Three-dimensional volume reconstructions showed, for the first time, the spatial distribution of the rafts within the gastric lumen.

Reflux of both food and acid into the oesophagus was measured for 3 h. There was a seven day wash-out period between each treatment. Food reflux in the control group was 22,878 +/- 14,385 counts x 10(3) and this was significantly suppressed by both Liquid Gaviscon (174 +/- 128 (s.e.) counts x 10(3); P = 0.003); however, although the reduction of food reflux to 3812 +/- 2322 counts x 10(3) observed after Algitec treatment was considerable, this did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05) due to the large intersubject variation. Liquid Gaviscon was significantly better at reducing food reflux than Algitec (P = 0.001). Gaviscon also significantly reduced acid reflux when compared with the control group (1.08 +/- 0.73 vs 5.87 +/- 3.27% recording time oesophageal pH < 4, respectively) (P = 0.03). The slight reduction in acid reflux after Algitec treatment (3.25 +/- 1.82% recording time oesophageal pH < 4) also did not reach statistical significance.
