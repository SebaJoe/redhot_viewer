Data were drawn from the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) study including FEP individuals\u00a0receiving treatment at sites randomized to provide either EIS (NAVIGATE) or community care (CC). Cannabis use was assessed monthly and symptom and functioning data were collected at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24\u00a0months. Among the 404 participants enrolled, 334 were classified into four cannabis use groups (consistent, sporadic, stopped, and never users) based on their use during the first year. Consistent and sporadic cannabis users were younger, whereas those who had stopped using were older. Sporadic users had the highest depression and the lowest functioning at baseline and improved less during treatment in negative emotions and intrapsychic foundations (e.g., motivation and sense of purpose) than non-users. However, sporadic users who received NAVIGATE improved more in overall symptoms and functioning than those who received CC. Consistent users did not tend to differ in their trajectories from non-users. Individuals with FEP who use cannabis sporadically showed less clinical improvement than non-users. However, EIS treatment reduced the negative effects of sporadic cannabis use on clinical outcomes. Those who use cannabis sporadically may have unique needs that require attention in EIS.",

Twenty-four subjects (12 occasional cannabis users and 12 heavy cannabis users) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way mixed model design. Both groups received single doses of THC placebo and 500 microg/kg THC by smoking. Performance tests were conducted at regular intervals between 0 and 8 h after smoking, and included measures of perceptual motor control (critical tracking task), dual task processing (divided attention task), motor inhibition (stop signal task) and cognition (Tower of London). THC significantly impaired performance of occasional cannabis users on critical tracking, divided attention and the stop signal task. THC did not affect the performance of heavy cannabis users except in the stop signal task, i.e. stop reaction time increased, particularly at high THC concentrations. Group comparisons of overall performance in occasional and heavy users did not reveal any persistent performance differences due to residual THC in heavy users.

Participants completed a baseline and an experimental mobile laboratory assessment that included 3 points: before, immediately after, and 1 hour after ad libitum legal market flower and concentrate use. Of the 133 individuals enrolled and assessed, 55 regular flower cannabis users (41.4%) and 66 regular concentrate cannabis users (49.6%) complied with the study's cannabis use instructions and had complete data across primary outcomes.\nExposures\n\n\nFlower users were randomly assigned to use either 16% or 24% THC flower and concentrate users were randomly assigned to use either 70% or 90% THC concentrate that they purchased from a dispensary.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\n\nPrimary outcome measures included plasma cannabinoids, subjective drug intoxication, and neurobehavioral tasks testing attention, memory, inhibitory control, and balance.\nResults\n\n\nA total of 121 participants completed the study for analysis: 55 flower users (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [8.1] years; 25 women [46%]) and 66 concentrate users (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [10.4] years; 30 women [45%]). Concentrate users compared with flower users exhibited higher plasma THC levels and 11-hydroxy\u03949-THC (THC's active metabolite) across all points. After ad libitum cannabis administration, mean plasma THC levels were 0.32 (SE\u2009=\u20090.43) \u03bcg/mL in concentrate users (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 3.18) and 0.14 (SE\u2009=\u20090.16) \u03bcg/mL in flower users. Most neurobehavioral measures were not altered by short-term cannabis consumption. However, delayed verbal memory (F1,203\u2009=\u200932.31; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and balance function (F1,203\u2009=\u200918.88; P\u2009<\u2009.001) were impaired after use. Differing outcomes for the type of product (flower vs concentrate) or potency within products were not observed.\nConclusions and Relevance\n\n\nThis study provides information about the association of pharmacological and neurobehavioral outcomes with legal market cannabis. Short-term use of concentrates was associated with higher levels of THC exposure. Across forms of cannabis and potencies, users' domains of verbal memory and proprioception-focused postural stability were primarily associated with THC administration.",

Youth reported subjective \"high\" while smoking, stimulation, sedation, stress, craving, and grams of marijuana used in the natural environment via wireless electronic devices. Bayesian multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) evaluated mediation via indirect effect tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSignificant within (daily) and between (person) variability and distinctive within and between effects supported the MSEM approach. Subjective high while smoking was significantly reduced for youth in the topiramate condition, relative to placebo, and the indirect effect of reduced subjective high on total grams of cannabis smoked that day was significant. Indirect effects through other subjective responses were not significant.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe results of this initial study suggest that altering subjective responses to smoking, specifically subjective high, may be a key target for developing adjunctive pharmacotherapies for cannabis misuse. More generally, this work provides an example for applying ecological momentary assessment and analytic techniques to evaluate mechanisms of behavior change in longitudinal data.",

N Engl J Med. 2018;378:1888-1897.\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nCannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2-55 years) who had had 2 or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg/kg (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in 2 equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percentage reduction from baseline in drop seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group ( P = .005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group, and P = .002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAmong children and adults with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/d to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. (Funded by GW Pharmaceuticals; GWPCARE3 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02224560.)

Epilepsia. 2018;59(8):1540-1548.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nSince 2014, cannabidiol (CBD) has been administered to patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies (TREs) in an ongoing expanded access program (EAP). We report interim results on the safety and efficacy of CBD in EAP patients treated through December 2016.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTwenty-five US-based EAP sites enrolling patients with TRE taking stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline were included. During the 4-week baseline period, parents/caregivers kept diaries of all countable seizure types. Patients received oral CBD starting at 2 to 10 mg/kg/d, titrated to a maximum dose of 25 to 50 mg/kg/d. Patient visits were every 2 to 4 weeks through 16 weeks and every 2 to 12 weeks thereafter. Efficacy end points included the percentage change from baseline in median monthly convulsive and total seizure frequency and percentage of patients with \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reductions in seizures versus baseline. Data were analyzed descriptively for the efficacy analysis set and using the last-observation-carried-forward method to account for missing data. Adverse events (AEs) were documented at each visit.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 607 patients in the safety data set, 146 (24%) withdrew; the most common reasons were lack of efficacy (89 [15%]) and AEs (32 [5%]). Mean age was 13 years (range, 0.4-62). Median number of concomitant AEDs was 3 (range, 0-10). Median CBD dose was 25 mg/kg/d; median treatment duration was 48 weeks. Add-on CBD reduced median monthly convulsive seizures by 51% and total seizures by 48% at 12 weeks; reductions were similar through 96 weeks. Proportion of patients with \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reductions in convulsive seizures were 52%, 31%, and 11%, respectively, at 12 weeks, with similar rates through 96 weeks. Cannabidiol was generally well tolerated; most common AEs were diarrhea (29%) and somnolence (22%).\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nResults from this ongoing EAP support previous observational and clinical trial data, showing that add-on CBD may be an efficacious long-term treatment option for TRE.

Neurology. 2018;90(14):e1204-e1211.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate the safety and preliminary pharmacokinetics of a pharmaceutical formulation of purified cannabidiol (CBD) in children with Dravet syndrome.\nMETHODS\n\n\nPatients aged 4 to 10 years were randomized 4:1 to CBD (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d) or placebo taken twice daily. The double-blind trial comprised 4-week baseline, 3-week treatment (including titration), 10-day taper, and 4-week follow-up periods. Completers could continue in an open-label extension. Multiple pharmacokinetic blood samples were taken on the first day of dosing and at end of treatment for measurement of CBD, its metabolites 6-OH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and 7-COOH-CBD, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; clobazam and metabolite N-desmethylclobazam [N-CLB], valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, and stiripentol). Safety assessments were clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse events (AEs), seizure frequency, and suicidality.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThirty-four patients were randomized (10, 8, and 9 to the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/d CBD groups and 7 to placebo); 32 (94%) completed treatment. Exposure to CBD and its metabolites was dose proportional (AUC 0-t ). Cannabidiol did not affect concomitant AED levels, apart from an increase in N-CLB (except in patients taking stiripentol). The most common AEs on CBD were pyrexia, somnolence, decreased appetite, sedation, vomiting, ataxia, and abnormal behavior. Six patients taking CBD and valproate developed elevated transaminases; none met criteria for drug-induced liver injury and all recovered. No other clinically relevant safety signals were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nExposure to CBD and its metabolites increased proportionally with dose. An interaction with N-CLB was observed, likely related to CBD inhibition of cytochrome P450 subtype 2C19. Cannabidiol resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE\n\n\nThis study provides class I evidence that for children with Dravet syndrome, CBD resulted in more AEs than placebo but was generally well tolerated.",

We compared the neural response to \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in healthy volunteers in whom the drug did or did not induce acute psychotic symptoms. Method In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pseudorandomized design, 21 healthy men with minimal experience of cannabis were given either 10\u00a0mg THC or placebo, orally. Behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures were then recorded whilst they performed a go/no-go task.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe sample was subdivided on the basis of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive score following administration of THC into transiently psychotic (TP; n\u00a0=\u00a011) and non-psychotic (NP; n\u00a0=\u00a010) groups. During the THC condition, TP subjects made more frequent inhibition errors than the NP group and showed differential activation relative to the NP group in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left and right middle temporal gyri and in the right cerebellum. In these regions, THC had opposite effects on activation relative to placebo in the two groups. The TP group also showed less activation than the NP group in the right middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum, independent of the effects of THC.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn this first demonstration of inter-subject variability in sensitivity to the psychotogenic effects of THC, we found that the presence of acute psychotic symptoms was associated with a differential effect of THC on activation in the ventral and medial temporal cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that these regions mediate the effects of the drug on psychotic symptoms.",

In the present study, we examined the role of the endocannabinoid system in executive function, focusing on both the associated brain network and the default mode network. A pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted with a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, investigating effects of the endocannabinoid agonist \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on executive function in 20 healthy volunteers, using a continuous performance task with identical pairs. Task performance was impaired after THC administration, reflected in both an increase in false alarms and a reduction in detected targets. This was associated with reduced deactivation in a set of brain regions linked to the default mode network, including posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. Less deactivation was significantly correlated with lower performance after THC. Regions that were activated by the continuous performance task, notably bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex, did not show effects of THC.

We investigated the effects of acute oral administration of 10mg of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on inhibitory control and regional brain activation during inhibitory processing in humans and examined whether these effects are related to the induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence using a repeated-measures, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design. We studied thirty-six healthy, English-speaking, right-handed men with minimal previous exposure to cannabis and other illicit drugs twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they performed a response inhibition (Go/No-Go) task. Relative to placebo, delta-9-THC caused transient psychotic symptoms, anxiety, intoxication and sedation, inhibition errors and impaired inhibition efficiency. Severity of psychotic symptoms was directly correlated with inhibition error frequency and inversely with inhibition efficiency under the influence of delta-9-THC. Delta-9-THC attenuated left inferior frontal activation which was inversely correlated with the frequency of inhibition errors and severity of psychotic symptoms and positively with inhibition efficiency under its influence. These results provide experimental evidence that impairments in cognitive processes involved in the inhibitory control of thoughts and actions and inferior frontal function under the influence of cannabis may have a role in the emergence of transient psychotic symptoms under its influence.",

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that LPR is a contributing factor in some cases of hoarseness, vocal fatigue, voice breaks, cough and globus and chronic throat clearing. However, several randomised placebo-controlled trials of proton pump inhibitors in the treatment of LPR have been reported with the majority showing no significant benefit in patient symptom scores over placebo. The aim of this pilot clinical study was to investigate whether any improvement in LPR-related symptoms, using the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), and clinical findings, using the Reflux Finding Score (RFS), could be achieved with treatment with a liquid alginate suspension compared to control (no treatment). Patients presenting with the symptoms of LPR to the Otorhinolaryngology Outpatient Department at the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK were considered eligible if they had an RSI of greater than 10 and an RFS greater than 5 based on a fibreoptic examination of the larynx. A total of 49 patients were randomised into the open, parallel group study; 24 patients were randomised to receive 10 ml liquid alginate suspension (Gaviscon Advance) four times daily after meals and at bedtime, and 25 patients into the control group (no treatment). Patients were assessed pre-treatment and at 2, 4 and 6 months post treatment.

Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) (sodium alginate 1,000\u2009mg three times daily) with a placebo was conducted on patients who fulfilled the criteria of at least one symptom consistent with LPRD, a total reflux symptom index (RSI) score of\u2009>\u200910, and a total reflux finding score (RFS) of\u2009>\u20095. Those with erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, as evidenced through screened transnasal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, were excluded. Efficacy was assessed by RSI, RFS, and ambulatory multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) monitoring.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 80 patients aged 22 to 72 years were enrolled. Compared with baseline, both Alginos (TTY Biopharm Co.

The improvement was significantly better in Group B RSI and RFS on both follow ups. On analysis of each RSI item at 8\u00a0weeks, choking sensation showed no significant improvement in Group A. All other items showed significant improvement in both groups, with all items except difficulty swallowing and choking sensation showing significantly better improvement in Group B. Analysis of each RFS item at 8\u00a0weeks, showed significant improvement in Group B but not in Group A. The addition of alginate to PPI shows greater definitive improvement in both symptoms and signs of LPRD within a short period of 8\u00a0weeks, compared to PPI monotherapy, making it a feasible treatment option with good results in routine practice in a rural set-up.

This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study conducted at 13 GP centres in the UK. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years, who had experienced symptoms of reflux oesophagitis within the previous 24 h, and on two other occasions within the previous week, were recruited into the study. Patients were evaluated at baseline, and then reassessed after two and four weeks of treatment with sodium alginate or placebo, for symptoms of reflux oesophagitis in the previous 24 h. Patients were required to fill out a diary card twice daily, from which frequency and severity of symptoms were assessed, and the percentage of symptom-free days and nights calculated. Of the 100 patients recruited into the study, 98 received medication (safety population; placebo, n = 50; sodium alginate, n = 48) and 94 were eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (placebo, n = 48; sodium alginate, n = 46). For this population, sodium alginate was assessed as significantly superior by both investigators and patients at week two (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively) and at week four (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Significantly more patients in the safety population on placebo withdrew from the study (40%) compared with sodium alginate (21%; p = 0.04), due primarily to lack of effect and adverse events. The sodium alginate preparation demonstrated a superior efficacy compared with placebo, which was achieved in a more acceptable volume of medication than a previous standard preparation, Liquid Gaviscon. The reduced dosage volume of the 'new' preparation (Gaviscon Advance) may be expected to improve patient compliance, and thereby increase treatment efficacy.",

Alginates decrease the number of reflux events by forming a raft on top of the stomach content and thus offer a supplemental mechanism of action to acid suppression.\nAIM\n\n\nTo assess the efficacy of an alginate (Gaviscon Advance, Reckitt Benckiser, Slough, UK) on reflux symptoms in patients with persistent symptoms despite once daily PPI.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis was a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, 7-day double-blind trial preceded by a 7-day run-in period. Reflux symptoms were assessed using the Heartburn Reflux Dyspepsia Questionnaire (HRDQ). Based on symptom score during run-in, eligible patients were randomised to Gaviscon Advance 10\u00a0mL four times a day or placebo in addition to a once daily PPI. The primary endpoint was change in HRDQ score post-treatment compared to baseline.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOne hundred and thirty-six patients were randomised. Change in HRDQ reflux score was significantly greater for Gaviscon Advance (mean: -5.0, s.d.: 4.7) than for placebo (mean: -3.5, s.d.: 5.5) with an LS mean difference of 1.6 [95% CI -3.1 to -0.1], P\u00a0=\u00a00.03. A decrease in the mean (s.d.) number of nights with symptoms was observed from 3.6 (2.8) to 3.0 (3.0) in the placebo group and from 3.9 (2.8) to 2.2 (2.7) for the Gaviscon Advance group. This reduction was significantly greater in the Gaviscon Advance group than in the placebo group [LS mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0-0.9, 95% CI (-1.6 to -0.2), P\u00a0<\u00a00.01].\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIn patients with residual reflux symptoms despite PPI treatment, adding an alginate offers additional decrease in the burden of reflux symptoms (EudraCT/IND Number: 2011-005486-21).",

Twenty infants and children with characteristic symptoms of GOR were divided at random into two groups which were given either Gaviscon (ten patients, mean age: 21 months) or a placebo (ten patients, mean age: 35 months). A continuous pH probe monitoring of the lower oesophageal third was performed in all the patients before and after 8 days of treatment. Before the trial, sensitive pH monitoring variables of acid reflux (Euler-Byrne index, percentage of total reflux time per 24 h, mean duration and percentage of reflux time during sleep, total number of reflux episodes per 24 h and number of reflux episodes per 2 h post-cibal periods) were abnormal in all the patients tested. The oesophagram revealed a GOR in 13 of the 20 patients; none of the children who underwent an endoscopy had evidence of oesophagitis. Episodes of regurgitation reported by the parents decreased during Gaviscon therapy while no clinical improvement was noticed in the placebo group. No adverse effects were observed. After 8 days of treatment with Gaviscon, results of all the pH monitoring variables were significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced between -35% and -61% of the initial values recorded. In the placebo treated group, the mean values remained little changes (-9.5 to +8.2% of initial values). These data suggest that Gaviscon may prove useful in the medical management of GOR in infants and children.",

This study describes the use of echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging (EPI) to visualise non-invasively intragastric alginate rafts of Liquid Gaviscon and Gaviscon Advance in healthy subjects. Secondly, the feasibility of using relaxation rate (T2(-1)) measurements to monitor changes in the physicochemical properties of the rafts in-vivo is evaluated. Six subjects ingested 500 mL of a liquid meal and received a single dose of 20 mL Liquid Gaviscon or 10 mL Gaviscon Advance on 2 separate visits each and were imaged every 15 min. An alginate raft was observed in the stomach for all subjects and both treatments. The raft was observed to consist of a few large fragments on the majority of the scans for both products. At t = 60 min a raft was still present in all cases. Three-dimensional volume reconstructions showed, for the first time, the spatial distribution of the rafts within the gastric lumen. The T2(-1) data showed potential for assessment of dynamic changes in the physicochemical properties of the alginate rafts in-vivo.

Subjects were fasted overnight before the study. A pH electrode and gamma detector were accurately positioned 5 cm above the cardia. The volunteers received a 99mTc-labelled meal designed to provoke reflux and then either remained untreated, or 30 min later were given either Algitec Suspension or Liquid Gaviscon. Reflux of both food and acid into the oesophagus was measured for 3 h. There was a seven day wash-out period between each treatment. Food reflux in the control group was 22,878 +/- 14,385 counts x 10(3) and this was significantly suppressed by both Liquid Gaviscon (174 +/- 128 (s.e.) counts x 10(3); P = 0.003); however, although the reduction of food reflux to 3812 +/- 2322 counts x 10(3) observed after Algitec treatment was considerable, this did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05) due to the large intersubject variation. Liquid Gaviscon was significantly better at reducing food reflux than Algitec (P = 0.001). Gaviscon also significantly reduced acid reflux when compared with the control group (1.08 +/- 0.73 vs 5.87 +/- 3.27% recording time oesophageal pH < 4, respectively) (P = 0.03). The slight reduction in acid reflux after Algitec treatment (3.25 +/- 1.82% recording time oesophageal pH < 4) also did not reach statistical significance.
