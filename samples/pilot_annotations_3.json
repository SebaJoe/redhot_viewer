Interaction terms were fitted in survival models to estimate the risk of both outcomes across levels of an overall microvascular disease score (range 0 to 100) and its individual components: diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.\nRESULTS\n\n\nDuring a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 1685 primary outcomes and 1806 deaths occurred in 9405 participants.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between fibrin clot properties and clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Plasma samples were collected at hospital discharge from 974 ACS patients with diabetes randomised to clopidogrel or ticagrelor in the PLATO trial. A validated turbidimetric assay was employed to study fibrin clot lysis and maximum turbidity. One-year rates of cardiovascular (CV) death, spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI) and PLATO-defined major bleeding events were assessed after sample collection. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined using Cox proportional analysis. After adjusting for CV risk factors, each 50% increase in lysis time was associated with increased risk of CV death/MI (HR 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.44;  p \u2009=\u20090.026) and CV death alone (HR 1.38; 1.08-1.76;  p \u2009=\u20090.01). Similarly, each 50% increase in maximum turbidity was associated with increased risk of CV death/MI (HR 1.25; 1.02-1.53;  p \u2009=\u20090.031) and CV death alone (HR 1.49; 1.08-2.04;  p \u2009=\u20090.014).

Whether this difference translates into different risks of complications remains controversial. We examined the long-term risk of microvascular complications in people enrolled in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), according to their diabetes autoimmunity status.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe did a post-hoc analysis of 30-year follow-up data from UKPDS (UKPDS 86). UKPDS participants with diabetes autoantibody measurements available and without previous microvascular events were included. Participants with at least one detectable autoantibody were identified as having latent autoimmune diabetes, and those who tested negative for all autoantibodies were identified as having type 2 diabetes. The incidence of the primary composite microvascular outcome (first occurrence of renal failure, renal death, blindness, vitreous haemorrhage, or retinal photocoagulation) was compared between adults with latent autoimmune diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes. The follow-up ended on Sept 30, 2007. Baseline and updated 9-year mean values of potential confounders were tested in Cox models to adjust hazard ratios (HRs). UKPDS is registered at the ISRCTN registry, 75451837.\nFINDINGS\n\n\nAmong the 5028 participants included, 564 had latent autoimmune diabetes and 4464 had type 2 diabetes. After median 17\u00b73 years (IQR 12\u00b76-20\u00b77) of follow-up, the composite microvascular outcome occurred in 1041 (21%) participants. The incidence for the composite microvascular outcome was 15\u00b78 (95% CI 13\u00b74-18\u00b77) per 1000 person-years in latent autoimmune diabetes and 14\u00b72 (13\u00b73-15\u00b72) per 1000 person-years in type 2 diabetes.

Case reports have reported thrombotic complications caused by COVID-19-related coagulopathy leading to limb loss. Alarmingly, many of these patients had no underlying vascular disease prior to being infected with COVID-19. Many of these case reports discuss patients developing gangrene in the intensive care unit (ICU). Our study compares the incidence of gangrene in the ICU in COVID-19 patients to baseline inpatient levels prior to the pandemic.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis retrospective analysis investigates two subsets of patients from a single institution. The first was from 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic; the second subset was from 2019 before the pandemic. Demographic data and medication history were ascertained for both groups. Primary outcomes measures included extremity gangrene that developed in the ICU, mortality, and major amputation.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere were 249 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the ICU in 2020. In 2019, 1,846 admissions to the ICU took place, of which 249 patients were randomized to chart review. There were 13 cases of gangrene that developed in the ICU, 12 of which took place in 2020. In-hospital mortality was 11.6% in nonCOVID-19 patients in 2019 vs. 41.4% in 2021 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Only 16.7% of the COVID-19 gangrene patients had previously known arterial disease. Also, patients in the COVID-19 group with gangrene were four times more likely to be smokers (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). When the data were stratified to compare between gangrene development and no gangrene development, the combined total gangrene group had longer hospital stays, higher need for blood transfusions, required major amputations, and revascularization. A multivariate logistic regression from the total study similarly demonstrated that COVID-19 infection is associated with an 18.23 times increased risk of gangrene.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCOVID-19 has resulted in an incomprehensible societal impact that will linger\u00a0for years to come. The last 2\u00a0years have reinforced that COVID-19 will be a part of our clinical practice indefinitely. This study emphasizes the importance of clinician awareness of COVID-19 induced critical limb ischemia in those without underlying arterial disease\u00a0and\u00a0few medical comorbidities.

        "a8_doc": "A common factor contributing to organ damage in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is impaired tissue blood flow caused by damage to vascular endothelial cells (VECs). Damage can occur even before the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. It can be caused by both a high average blood glucose concentration and/or large daily spikes in blood glucose. While much of the present literature focuses on the damage to VECs and organs from these large glucose excursions, this review will focus on the consequence of this damage, that is, how endothelial cell damage in diabetes affects normal daily activities (e.g., exercise, reaction to typical stimuli) and various treatment modalities (e.g.. contrast baths and electrical stimulation therapy). It is important to understand the effects of VEC damage such as poor skin blood flow, compromised thermoregulation, and altered response to skin pressure in designing diabetes technologies as simple as heating pads and as complex as continuous glucose monitors. At the simplest level, people with diabetes have poor circulation to the skin and other organs. In the skin, even the blood flow response to locally applied pressure, such as during standing, is different than for people who do not have T2DM. Simple weight bearing on the foot can occlude the skin circulation. This makes the skin more susceptible to damage. In addition, endothelial damage has far-reaching effects on the whole body during normal activities of daily living, including an impaired response to local heat, such as hot packs and contrast baths, and higher body temperatures during whole body heating due to impaired blood flow and a reduced ability to sweat. Finally, because of multiple organ damage, people with T2DM have poor balance and gait and impaired exercise performance.",

The participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated Feb 7, 2020). We ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care).

        "a10_doc": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\nCOVID-19 causes a considerable degradation of pulmonary function to the point of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Over the course of the disease the gas exchange capability of the lung can get impaired to such an extent that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is needed as a life-saving intervention. In patients COVID-19 as well as ECMO may cause severe coagulopathies which manifest themselves in micro and macro thrombosis. Previous studies established D-dimers as a marker for critical thrombosis of the ECMO system while on admission increased D-dimers are associated with a higher mortality in COIVD-19 patients. It is therefore crucial to determine if COVID-19 poses an increased risk of early thrombosis of the vital ECMO system.\nMETHODS\n\n\n40 patients who required ECMO support were enrolled in a retrospective analysis and assigned into 2 groups. The COVID group consist of 20 COVID-19 patients who required ECMO support (n\u200a=\u200a20), whereas 20 ECMO patients without COVID-19 were assigned to the control group. D-dimers, fibrinogen, antithrombin III (AT III), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and platelet count were analysed using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing and MANOVAs.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe analysis of both groups shows highly significant differences in the dynamics of hemostasis. The increase in D-dimers that is associated with thrombosis of the ECMO systems occurs in COVID-19 patients around 2 days earlier (p\u200a=\u200a2,8115 10-11) while fibrinogen is consumed steadily. In the control group fibrinogen levels increase rapidly after ten days with a plateau phase of around five days (p\u200a=\u200a1,407 10-3)\u00a0. Both groups experience a rapid increase in AT III after start of support by ECMO (p\u200a=\u200a5,96 10-15). In the COVID group platelet count decreased from 210 giga/l to 130 giga/l within eight days, while in the same time span in the control group platelets decreased from 180 giga/l to 105 giga/l (p\u200a=\u200a1,1 10-15). In both groups a marked increase in LDH beyond 5000 U/l occurs (p\u200a=\u200a3,0865 10-15).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe early increase in D-dimers and decrease in fibrinogen suggests that COVID-19 patients bear an increased risk of early thrombosis of the ECMO system compared to other diseases treated with ECMO. Additionally, the control group shows signs of severe inflammation 10 days after the start of ECMO which were absent in COVID-19 patients.",

Additionally, to examine whether having insurance decrease the financial pressures of diabetes care.\nDESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS\n\n\nRacially/ethnically diverse patients (N\u2009=\u20091,361; 249 non-Hispanic whites, 194 Vietnamese, and 533 Mexican American) with type 2 diabetes were recruited from seven outpatient clinics for a cross-sectional, observational study.\nKEY RESULTS\n\n\nAlthough both Vietnamese and Mexican-American patients reported having low annual incomes, more Mexican Americans reported the presence of financial barriers to getting medical care and perceived financial burden due to their diabetes, compared to whites and Vietnamese (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Over half (53.2%) of Mexican Americans reported cost-related non-adherence compared to 27.2% of white and 27.6% of Vietnamese patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Perceived financial burden was found to be associated with poor glucose control (HbA1c \u22658%), after adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics (aOR\u2009=\u20091.70, 95%CI 1.09-2.63), but not when adjusting for non-adherence. Similarly, a significant association between presence of financial barriers and HbA1c (aOR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95%CI 1.23-2.32) was attenuated with the inclusion of insurance status in the model. Being uninsured (aOR\u2009=\u20091.90, 95%CI 1.13-3.21) and non-adherent (aOR\u2009=\u20091.49, 95%CI 1.06-2.08) were each independently associated with HbA1c.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWhile having health insurance coverage eliminated some of the financial barriers associated with having diabetes, low-income patients still faced significant financial burdens. Thus, providing health insurance to more individuals is only the first step towards eliminating health disparities. It is important to address medication cost in order to improve medication adherence and glucose control.",

Although there is an abundance of literature concerning the medical management of diabetes, few studies have assessed the financial impact of its treatment. This study examined the savings in prescription costs associated with a weight reduction program for obese men and women with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\n\n\nForty subjects ages 40-70 years who had body mass indexes of 30-40 kg/m2 and NIDDM of more than 1 year duration were assigned to one of two 800-kcal weight-loss programs for 12 weeks. A cost analysis was done on the 32 subjects who were taking anti-hypertensive and/or anti-diabetes medications. A list of medications and monthly amounts was obtained at the start, upon completion, and 1 year following completion of the diet. The average out-of-pocket cost for a month's supply of each prescription was calculated by polling 16 retail pharmacies in Lexington, Kentucky.\nRESULTS\n\n\nSubjects lost an average of 15.3 kg (33.7 lb) over the 12 weeks. At 1-year follow-up, subjects maintained a mean 9.0-kg (19.8 lb) weight loss. The average monthly prediet out-of-pocket cost for anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetes medications and supplies was $63.30 per subject. Following completion of the diet, this cost per month decreased to $20.40 and at 1-year follow-up the average monthly cost per subject was $32.40. The estimated average savings in prescription costs per subject over the year was $442.80.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nSignificant short- and long-term savings in prescription costs were obtained following a 12-week hypocaloric weight reduction program for obese individuals with NIDDM.",

Little is known about preferences and frequency of physician-patient discussions about cost/affordability among individuals managing respiratory conditions.\nOBJECTIVES\n\n\nTo examine who has a preference to discuss the cost of their asthma care with their physician, how often physician-patient communication about cost/affordability actually is occurring, and what clinical and demographic characteristics of patients are predictive of communication.\nMETHODS\n\n\nData came from 422 African American adult women with asthma who were asked about communication preferences and practices around cost and affordability with their physician. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple variable logistic regression models.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\n\n\nFifty-two percent (n\u2009=\u2009219) of this sample perceived financial burden. Seventy-two percent (n\u2009=\u2009300) reported a preference to discuss cost with their health-care provider. Thirty-nine percent (n\u2009=\u2009163) reported actually having a conversation with their physician about cost. Among the 61% who reported no discussion, 40% (n\u2009=\u2009103) reported financial burden, and 55% (n\u2009=\u2009140) reported a preference for discussion. Lower household income (P\u2009<\u20090.001), perception of financial burden (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and higher out-of-pocket expenses for medicines (P\u2009<\u20090.05) were significantly predictive of greater preference to communicate about cost/affordability with the doctor when adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. Perception of financial burden (P\u2009<\u20090.001), preference to discuss affordability (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and greater number of chronic conditions (P\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly predictive of greater likelihood of communication about cost/affordability with the doctor when adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. Bivariate analyses revealed that patients who reported a discussion of cost were more likely to report worse asthma control and lower asthma-related quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nAn imbalance is evident between patients who would like to discuss cost with their doctor and those who actually do. Patients are interested in low-cost options and a venue for addressing their concerns with a care provider; therefore, a greater understanding is needed in how to effectively and efficiently integrate these conversations and viable solutions into the delivery of health care. Additional research is necessary to determine whether communication about the cost of therapy is associated with health outcomes.",

Medication costs were evaluated at months 0, 6, and 18.\nRESULTS\n\n\nParticipants assigned to Intensified Maintenance maintained nearly all their lost weight, whereas those assigned to Standard Maintenance regained weight. However, no significant differences in medication costs were observed within or between groups during the 18\u00a0months of the trial. A reduction of nearly $30 per month (12.9 %) was observed among all participants from month 0 to month 6 (active weight loss phase), but this difference did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nA behavioral intervention that led to clinically significant weight loss did not lead to statistically significant reductions in medication costs. Substantial variability in medication costs and lack of a systematic approach by the study team to reduce medications may explain the lack of effect.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nThe trial was registered at (NCT01220089) on September 23, 2010.",

This effect, however, has yet to be demonstrated for medications used for the treatment of asthma.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo evaluate the impact of a value-based health management asthma program-which included providing patient education and lowering copayments for select asthma controller medications-on medication adherence and healthcare utilization and costs.\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\n\nThe study involved a quasi-experimental intervention versus control group design of insured patients diagnosed with asthma.\nMETHOD\n\n\nAfter applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria for study participation, we obtained informed consent from the intervention group; those eligible to participate who did not return the forms served as the control group. The final sample size included 764 patients with asthma-298 in the intervention group and 466 in the control group. The intervention consisted of a reduction in copayment for select asthma controller medications from an average of $20 to $30 down to $5, as well as 3 mailings of educational materials for asthma management. Medical and pharmacy claims data for the study population were used to evaluate all study parameters and outcomes. Medication possession ratio was used to measure adherence to asthma controller medications. Statistical models were used to study differences in the 2 study groups during the 12-month follow-up period for adherence and cost outcomes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nParticipation in the value-based health management asthma program increased patients' 12-month medication adherence by 10 absolute percentage points in the intervention group (53.9% for intervention vs 43.9% for control group, P <.001) and significantly decreased average monthly medical costs ($170 intervention vs $229 control, P = .004). This increase in adherence resulted in greater monthly pharmacy costs ($181 intervention vs $124 control, P <.001). However, the increase in pharmacy costs was offset by lower medical costs, leading to a nonsignificant increase in average monthly total healthcare costs ($362 intervention vs $337 control, P = .276).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAdoption of a value-based health management program that combines patient education with lowered copayments has a positive impact on medication adherence, resulting in a reduction in associated medical costs and no significant increase in total costs.",

This study examines how perceptions of chronic illness care attenuate the relationship between adherence and cost burden.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSurveys were administered to patients at 40 small community-based primary care practices. Medication adherence was assessed using the 4-item Morisky scale, while five cost-related items documented recent pharmacy restrictions. CCM experiences were assessed via the 20-item Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC). Nested random effects models determined if chronic care perceptions modified the association between medication adherence and cost-related burden.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOf 1823 respondents reporting diabetes and other chronic diseases, one-quarter endorsed intrapersonal adherence barriers, while 23% restricted medication due of cost. Controlling for age and health status, the relationship between medication cost and CCM with adherence was significant; including PACIC scores attenuated cost-related problems patients with adequate or problematic adherence behavior.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nPatients experiencing treatment more consistent with the CCM reported better adherence and lower cost-related burden.

Some plans placed selected generic OADs and statins on zero co-pay tiers whereas others did not. Randomization eliminated selection effects which could bias the study findings.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe analyzed a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes from the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse using Part D claims, formulary provisions, and co-pay tiers together with a special file prepared by CMS that identified all randomly assigned LIS recipients in 2008. We calculated proportions using generic drugs in the 2 classes and annual days' supply among users in plans with and without zero co-pay tiers for the country as a whole and California (where zero co-pay plans were particularly popular).\nRESULTS\n\n\nWe found that the demand for generic OADs was not significantly different in plans with and without zero co-pay tiers. By contrast, a large difference was observed in the percent of LIS recipients using generic statins in plans with zero co-pay tiers (61.4% vs 54.6%; P <.01). However, the difference disappeared once we controlled for formulary restrictions on the most popular brand statin at the time (Lipitor).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThis cautionary tale suggests that policy makers should give greater consideration to formulary provisions when evaluating the effects of free generics in value-based insurance designs.",

At baseline, 0.5, 1.5, 4, 6, and 10 years, sleep disorders and hallucinations were assessed by standardized scales with the longitudinal data analyzed by generalized estimating equations with assumptions of linearity in time.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt 10 years, we could account for all subjects (27 interviewed, 61 deceased, and 1 too ill for interview). Hallucination prevalence and severity increased over time (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0001). Acting out dreams also increased over time (p = 0.001). In contrast, presence of vivid dreams/nightmares or sleep fragmentation did not increase over time. For all visits, the prevalence of sleep fragmentation did not differ between subjects with vs without hallucinations (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, p = 0.09). However, severe sleep fragmentation was associated with concurrent hallucinations (OR 2.01, p = 0.006). The presence of hallucinations was also highly associated with concurrent vivid dreams/nightmares (OR = 2.60, p < 0.0001) and with concurrent acting out dreams (OR = 2.38, p = 0.0004). Among the baseline nonhallucinators, no sleep abnormalities at study entry predicted future development of hallucinations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nHallucinations and sleep abnormalities follow very different patterns of progression in PD over 10 years. Whereas patients with hallucinations often have concurrent sleep aberrations, no sleep problem is predictive of future hallucinations.",

        "a2_doc": "Idiopathic hypersomnia continues to evolve from the concept of \"sleep drunkenness\" introduced by Bedrich Roth in Prague in 1956 and the description of idiopathic hypersomnia with two forms, polysymptomatic and monosymptomatic, by the same Bedrich Roth in 1976. The diagnostic criteria of idiopathic hypersomnia have varied with the successive revisions of the International classifications of sleep disorders, including the recent 3rd edition. No epidemiological studies have been conducted so far. Disease onset occurs most often during adolescence or young adulthood. A familial background is often present but rigorous studies are still lacking. The key manifestation is hypersomnolence. It is often accompanied by sleep of long duration and debilitating sleep inertia. Polysomnography (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is mandatory, as well as a 24\u00a0h\u00a0PSG or a 2-wk actigraphy in association with a sleep log to ensure a total 24-h\u00a0sleep time longer than or equal to 66O minutes, when the mean sleep latency on the MSLT is longer than 8\u00a0min. Yet, MSLT is neither sensitive nor specific and the polysomnographic diagnostic criteria require continuous readjustment and biologic markers are still lacking. Idiopathic hypersomnia is most often a chronic condition though spontaneous remission may occur. The condition is disabling, sometimes even more so than narcolepsy type 1 or 2. Based on neurochemical, genetic and immunological analyses as well as on exploration of the homeostatic and circadian processes of sleep, various pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed. Differential diagnosis involves a number of diseases and it is not yet clear whether idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy type 2 are not the same condition. Until now, the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia has mirrored that of the sleepiness of narcolepsy type 1 or 2. The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of modafinil have just been published, as well as a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of clarithromycine, a negative allosteric modulator of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A receptor.",

        "a3_doc": "Exploding head syndrome is a sensory parasomnia characterized by the perception of loud noises and/or a sense of explosion in the head that occurs when transitioning to or from sleep. Despite receiving little attention from both researchers and clinicians, studies suggest that approximately 10%-15% of individuals have episodes, with significant levels of fear occurring in a subset of cases. Using two independent samples, we examine sleep and well-being variables associated with exploding head syndrome. We focused on insomnia symptoms, life stress, anxiety and depression symptoms, and sleep experiences such as sleep paralysis as potential factors associated with exploding head syndrome. Study 1 consisted of 199 female undergraduate students. We found a lifetime prevalence of 37.19%, with 6.54% experiencing at least one episode a month. All variables were associated with exploding head syndrome in univariate analyses, but only insomnia symptoms and sleep paralysis frequency were significantly associated with exploding head syndrome in multiple logistic regression models. Study 2 was an international sample of 1683 participants (age range 18-82, 53.00% female). Lifetime prevalence was 29.59%, with monthly episodes occurring in 3.89% of participants. The same set of variables was investigated as in Study 1, with dissociative experiences during wakefulness and a larger range of sleep experiences also included. Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1. In addition, dissociative experiences during wakefulness and other sleep experiences such as nightmares were associated with exploding head syndrome in multiple logistic regression models. These studies provide valuable first insights into variables associated with exploding head syndrome.Clinical trial information: Study 1 constitutes a planned exploratory outcome of a pilot feasibility study conducted to provide information useful for designing a clinical trial: Name: STOP-pilot.

There were also significantly fewer attacks of sleep paralysis, whilst the effects on nightmare and hypnogenic hallucinations were minor. The frequency of sleep attacks decreased slightly during femoxetine treatment, but the overall estimated sleep time during the day and excessive daytime sleepiness remained un-affected. An ambulatory sleep recording for 48 h one week after the start of the femoxetine and placebo period showed that femoxetine treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the total time spent in REM sleep. The side-effects of femoxetine were restricted to transient nausea in 2 patients.

The clinical impact of CBT-H was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and other patient-reported outcomes collected online at baseline and posttreatment. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and telehealth model was also evaluated using qualitative data collected from exit interviews conducted through videoconferencing.\nRESULTS\n\n\nForty percent of the sample achieved a clinically significant baseline to posttreatment change in depressive symptoms (decrease in Patient Health Questionnaire \u2265 5), which is below the prespecified efficacy benchmark (50% of the sample). The prespecified benchmark for a minimal clinically important difference (Cohen's d > 0.5) on other psychosocial measures was met only on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System global self-efficacy (d = 0.62) in the total sample. Qualitative data revealed enthusiasm for the accessibility of telehealth delivery and the usefulness of several cognitive and behavioral modules but also revealed opportunities to refine the CBT-H program.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThese findings indicate that this new CBT-H program can potentially reduce depressive symptoms and improve self-efficacy in people with central disorders of hypersomnolence.

        "a7_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nThe neuropeptides hypocretin-1 and -2 (hcrt-1 and -2, also known as orexin A and B) are crucially involved in the regulation of sleep/wake states. On the one hand, the sleep-wake disorder narcolepsy can be caused by an hcrt-1 deficiency. On the other, intracerebral administration of hcrt-1 produces an increase in wakefulness at the expense of REM sleep in normal and narcoleptic animals. In humans intranasal administration has been shown to effectively deliver neuropeptides directly to the central nervous system. We hypothesised that the intranasal application of hcrt-1 increases wakefulness and reduces REM sleep in the natural human hcrt-1 deficiency narcolepsy with cataplexy.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIn this double-blind, random-order crossover, placebo-controlled, within-subject design study we administered human recombinant hcrt-1 (435 nmol) intranasally to eight subjects with narcolepsy with cataplexy before night sleep, followed by standard polysomnography.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAlthough intranasal administration of hcrt-1 had no statistically significant effect on nocturnal wakefulness, we found that it reduced REM sleep quantity, particularly during the second half of the recording. Furthermore, intranasal hcrt-1 had a clear REM sleep stabilising effect and led to significantly reduced direct wake to REM transitions.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nIn this pilot study we found, first, evidence that the intranasal administration of hcrt-1 has functional effects on sleep in narcolepsy with cataplexy. Our results may encourage the use of the intranasal approach in further studies on hypocretinergic sleep regulation and might also contribute to the future development of a causal treatment for narcolepsy with cataplexy.",

Thirty-five nondemented and nonpsychotic PD patients with normal visual acuity and without major ophthalmologic disease were interviewed twice and divided into two groups: hallucinators (n = 14) and non-hallucinating controls (n = 21). The groups were compared for color vision (assessed by Lanthony D-15 [LD] and Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue [FM] tests), and for contrast sensitivity (tested by Vis tech tables [VT] and monocular and binocular Pelli-Robson test [PR]). There was no difference in age, duration or stage of PD, or dosage or duration of levodopa therapy between the two groups. Parkinson's disease patients showed impairment on all visual tests, with the hallucinators performing worse than the controls on all tests. This difference was significant for the LD (p < 0.007), the VT at 1.5 and 3 cycles per degree (p < 0.037 and 0.043, respectively) and the monocular PR tests (p < 0.049). The results led the authors to conclude that in patients with normal visual acuity, those with VH show added visual deficits of color and contrast discrimination. These ophthalmopathies may therefore be facilitating factors for visual hallucinations in PD and justify more focused research on the pathophysiology of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.",

County-wide random digit dialing telephone surveys were supplemented with door-to-door recruitment in three Arizona border communities. Utilizing a two-step screening process, individuals with a seizure disorder or epilepsy were identified. A consensus diagnosis was arrived at after reviewing results from the detailed interview, medical records and clinical examination.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 15,738 household individuals were surveyed. Two hundred and three individuals were identified as having had epilepsy at some point in their life; 25% of them were previously not diagnosed. The sex and age-adjusted prevalence estimate was 14.3 per 1000 (95% CI: 12.5-16.1) for lifetime epilepsy, and 11.8 per 1000 (CI: 10.2-13.5) for active epilepsy (seizures in the past 5 years or currently taking antiseizure medications). Non-Hispanic Whites were two times more likely to have active epilepsy than Hispanics. The majority of individuals with lifetime history of epilepsy had idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy; most were localization-related epilepsy although the exact location could not be determined for the majority. Although most individuals with epilepsy report receiving care from a neurology specialist, they were more likely to have visited a non-specialist in the past 3 months.\nSIGNIFICANCE\n\n\nThe lower prevalence of epilepsy among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics supports previous survey findings in the Southwest US and may be due to language, acculturation factors, stigma, or a reflection of the \"healthy immigrant effect\". The surprisingly high proportion of previously un-diagnosed individuals shows a need for further investigation as well as a need to increase community awareness.",

Inflammation is a substantial indicator of epilepsy risk. In this study, we evaluated whether chronic osteomyelitis (COM), a chronic inflammatory disease, increases epilepsy risk.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nA Taiwanese national insurance claims dataset of more than 22 million enrollees was used to select 20,996 COM patients and 83,973 randomly selected age- and gender-matched controls to investigate epilepsy development over an 11-year follow-up period, starting on January 1, 2000 and ending on December 31, 2010. The epilepsy risk was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.\nRESULTS\n\n\nComorbidities known to elevate epilepsy risk, including diabetes, hypertension, head injury, stroke, and cancer, were commonly noted in the COM cohort, which had considerably higher risk of epilepsy than did the control group. Comparing only those without comorbidities, COM patients still exhibited higher epilepsy risk than the control group did (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.01-4.98). The younger population exhibited an even greater risk (age \u226439 years: aHR=6.10, 95% CI: 4.00-9.30; age \u226565 years: aHR=1.66, 95% CI: 1.28-2.16).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis is the first study linking COM to an increased risk in epilepsy development. The results demonstrated that COM is a significant predictor of epilepsy. Further study of COM patients, particularly young patients, is recommended to facilitate epilepsy prevention.",

Out of this sample, 578 dropped out leaving 3066 males (51.8%) and 2854 females (48.2%). There were 3660 (61.8%) urban residents and 2260 (38.2%) from the rural community. Patients were evaluated using a screening questionnaire for epilepsy, and then referred to the hospital to be re-evaluated by a qualified neurologist and with electroencephalography (EEG) and computed tomography of the brain (CT).\nRESULTS\n\n\nSeventy-five cases were diagnosed with epilepsy giving an overall the crude lifetime prevalence rate (CPR) for epilepsy of 12.67/1000 (95% CI: 9.8-15.54). The active prevalence rate was 9.3/1000 and the incidence rate was 1.5/1000 (95% confidence interval: 0.53-2.51). Fifty-six cases (75%) had idiopathic epilepsy (CPR 9.5/1000). Symptomatic epilepsy was recorded in 19 (25%) cases (CPR 3.2/1000). Generalized seizures were more common (CPR 6.75/1000) than partial seizures (CPR 2.5/1000). The prevalence rate of partial seizures evolving to secondary generalization was 0.84/1000 while simple partial and complex partial seizures had CPR 1.4/1000 and 0.34/1000, respectively. The CPR of mixed seizures was 0.17/1000. Epilepsy was slightly but not significantly more common among males than females (CPR of 14.4 and 10.9 per 1000 population, respectively). The CPR was higher in rural than urban populations (17.7/1000, with 95% CI 12.2-23.18 and 9.56/1000, with 95% CI: 6.39-12.7, respectively) and in the illiterate group than the literate population (12.02/1000 and 9.94/1000, respectively). The highest prevalence rate was recorded in the early and late childhood period (69.78/100,000 and 43.78/100,000, respectively). Prenatal insults and infection represented major causes of symptomatic epilepsy.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe found a high prevalence rate of epilepsy (comparable with that in other Arabic and European countries) in our community particularly among children and teenagers. Overall the prevalence was higher in the rural than in the urban population. A family history of epilepsy, prenatal insults, and infection represented major risk factors of symptomatic epilepsy.",

        "a6_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages of using \"epileptic\" as a noun to describe someone with epilepsy have long been debated. Recent high-profile recommendations have stated that the term should not be used, including in English, as it perpetuates stigma. This decision was largely informed by a Brazilian Global Campaign Against Epilepsy study that reported experimental evidence indicating that, with students, the label evokes more negative attitudes than \"person with epilepsy\". The generalizability of this effect to different countries/cultures, and thus the justification for the recommendations, has never been tested.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe replicated the Brazilian study in the UK, in English, while also addressing methodological limitations. It was powered to detect the effects reported by the Brazilian study, with 234 students completing a survey regarding epilepsy attitudes. Half were randomized to Group 1 and half to Group 2. In Group 1, patients were referred to as \"people/person with epilepsy\" within the attitudinal measures, while in Group 2 they were referred to as \"epileptic/s\". Measures included translations of the questions used in the Brazilian study and the Attitudes and Beliefs about Living with Epilepsy scale. Participants' epilepsy familiarity and knowledge were also assessed.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe two groups were comparable in characteristics. A comparison of their responses to the attitude measures revealed no statistically significant or meaningful differences.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nIn this English replication, the word \"epileptic\" did not provoke more negative attitudes. This suggests that the effect reported by the Brazilian study might be culturally dependent. Methodological limitations to that study might also be relevant. Our results have implications for the global debate about how negative attitudes towards epilepsy might be addressed. Simply not saying \"epileptic\" may not promote the positive attitudes towards epilepsy that had been expected. To know how to best refer to those with epilepsy, evidence on the preferences of those actually living with epilepsy is needed.",

Patients with recurrent, unprovoked epileptic seizures with no associated initial neurologic impairment or disability, termed those with \"epilepsy only\" (n = 100), were compared with matched controls for self-reported physical activity, health experience, laboratory tests, body mass index, and muscle power tests.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOn the basis of muscle tests, physical fitness proved to be significantly poorer in patients with \"epilepsy only\" than in matched controls. During the preceding year, 22% of patients and 24% of controls had reduced their physical activities because of some illness; only 2% reduced their physical activities because of epilepsy. No significant difference was found in blood status, except for a lower serum creatinine level in the patients. Current antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy appeared significantly associated with lower hemoglobin and creatinine levels and higher high-density lipoprotein values. The patients perceived their health status to be comparable with that of controls, irrespective of physical inactivity, continued seizures, or AED monotherapy. However, patients receiving AED polytherapy perceived their health as rather poor or very poor significantly more often than did controls.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nBased on objective muscle tests, adults with childhood-onset \"epilepsy only\" have poorer physical fitness than do matched controls, but they have a feeling of good personal health.",

Beneficiaries were 65 years of age or older, with continuous Medicare Part A and Part B coverage and not in managed care plans. Epilepsy cases were identified from claims for physician visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient procedures. We used logistic regressions for the overall sample and stratified by gender to determine whether risk of new-onset epilepsy was associated with prior history of psychiatric (i.e., depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder, and substance abuse/dependence) and neurologic conditions (i.e., cerebrovascular disease, dementia, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, metastatic cancer).\nRESULTS\n\n\nPreexisting psychiatric disorders were significantly associated with new-onset epilepsy in the study population as were the neurologic conditions evaluated.

Evidence for stigma was also sought from local medical personnel. 144 patients and 98 controls were questioned again 12 months later at study completion to see whether their perceptions had changed. Both intellectual and physical abilities of people with epilepsy were regarded as low by controls, and this opinion did not change over the study period. Observations by medical personnel also suggested stigmatizing attitudes in the community. The number of patients reporting problems with their marriage or childbearing as a result of their epilepsy did not alter over the 12-month period, unlike their estimates of their own intellectual and physical capacities which had significantly improved. Conversely, although their expectations of employment outside the home had diminished, the reasons stated for this related to continuing epilepsy and not to the objections of fellow workers and employers.",

Self-administered questionnaires were issued to 755 patients with epilepsy (ICD 10: G40.0 to G40.9) and 1000 randomly selected controls from the background population.\nRESULTS\n\n\nA total of 345 patients (median age: 45, range 17-80 years) and 654 control subjects (median age: 43, range 19-93 years) returned the questionnaire. Before epilepsy was diagnosed there was no difference in overall fracture rate between patients and controls (RR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.3). After the diagnosis the overall fracture rate was significantly higher in the patients (RR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6-2.5). Fractures of the spine, forearms, femurs, lower legs, and feet and toes were significantly increased. Fractures related to seizures accounted for 33.9% (95% CI: 25.3-43.5%) of all fractures. After elimination of seizure related fractures the increase in fracture frequency was only borderline significant: RR = 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.7, P = 0.042). No difference in fracture energy between patients and controls was observed (low energy fractures: 1.7/1.4%, medium energy fractures: 59.8/52.0%, and high energy fractures: 38.3/46.6%). Use of phenytoin (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.4) and a family fracture history (OR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3-4.6) was associated with an increased fracture risk.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nFractures were more common in epileptics than in controls especially among users of phenytoin. Most of the increase in fracture frequency was related to seizures and not to low bone biomechanical competence.",

Secondary objectives will include functional capacity, quality of life, perceived stress, sleep quality (questionnaires), respiratory capacity (spirometry test), coagulation, inflammatory and oxidative-stress profile (blood draw), cognition (neuropsychological tests), neurovascular coupling and pulsatility (fNIRS). The COVID-Rehab project was a randomised clinical trial with two intervention arms (1:1 ratio) that will be blindly evaluated. It will recruit a total of 40 individuals: (1) rehabilitation: centre-based exercise-training program (eight weeks, three times per week); (2) control: individuals will have to maintain their daily habits.

Data from 30 weeks of the parent study were used for this analysis. Daily step count and sleep duration were extracted from activity monitor data, and participants self-reported knee pain, positive mood, and negative mood via surveys. Metrics were averaged within each participant and then across all participants for pre-pandemic, stay-at-home, and reopening periods, reflecting the phased re-opening in the state of Massachusetts.\nResults\n\n\nData from 28 participants showed small changes with inconclusive clinical significance during the stay-at-home and reopening periods compared to pre-pandemic for all outcomes. Summary statistics suggested substantial variability across participants with some participants showing persistent declines in physical activity during the observation period.\nConclusion\n\n\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, sleep, pain, and mood were variable across individuals with OA. Specific reasons for this variability could not be determined. Identifying factors that could affect individuals with knee OA who may exhibit reduced physical activity and/or worse symptoms during major lifestyle changes (such as the ongoing pandemic) is important for providing targeted healthcare services and management advice towards those that could benefit from it the most.",

Participants ( N  = 1,110) were presented with a scenario describing a positive COVID-19 test result, followed by one of eight scenarios describing a long COVID diagnosis and then completed outcome measures of illness expectations including: symptom severity, symptom duration, quality of life, personal control, treatment control, and illness coherence.\nRESULTS\n\n\nWe ran a series of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 ANOVAs on the outcome variables. We found a main effect of illness description: individuals reported longer symptom duration and less illness coherence when the illness was described as long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). There was a main effect of symptom uncertainty: when uncertainty was emphasized, participants reported longer expected symptom duration (p < .001), less treatment control ( p  = .031), and less illness coherence ( p  < .001) than when uncertainty was not emphasized. There was a main effect of efficacy of support: participants reported higher personal control ( p  = .004) and higher treatment control ( p  = .037) when support was enhanced (compared to basic support).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCommunications around long COVID should avoid emphasizing symptom uncertainty and aim to provide people with access to additional support and information on how they can facilitate their recovery.

We aimed to assess the effects of physical exercising on post-COVID-19-symptoms, physical/mental capacities and workability within a workplace-health-promotion project in health-care personnel.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nThirty-two HCWs were enrolled in two groups based on Post-COVID-Functional Scale (PCFS) scores: (1) severe (SSG,  n \u2009=\u200911) and (2) mild (MSG,  n \u2009=\u200921) symptoms. The participants underwent an eight week exercise intervention program consisting of two supervised resistance exercise sessions per week plus individual aerobic exercise recommendations. Primary outcome-parameter for physical fitness was VO 2 peak. Further, physical function (6MWT, 30\u2009s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS)), mental health (anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), stress (PSS-10), fatigue (BFI), resilience (BRS)), cognitive capacity (MoCA) and workability (WAI) were assessed at baseline, after 4\u00a0weeks and after completion of exercise intervention.\nRESULTS\n\n\nVO 2 peak improved significantly in the SSG by 2.4\u2009ml/kg/min (95% CI [1.48; 3.01], adj. p \u2009<\u20090.001) and non-significantly in the MSG by 1.27\u2009ml/kg/min (adj. p \u2009=\u20090.096). Both groups significantly improved their 30secSTS ( p \u2009=\u20090.0236) and 6MWT ( p \u2009=\u20090.0252) outcomes in both follow-ups (4\u00a0weeks and 8\u00a0weeks after inclusion). The SSG improved more than the MSG in VO 2 peak and 6MWT both after 4 and 8\u00a0weeks, respectively, although not statistically significant; findings were vice versa for the 30secSTS. 30secSTS outcomes correlated significantly with mental health outcomes and workability.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nPost-COVID exercise intervention improved physical fitness, psychological outcomes and workability in HCWs. Cases with severe fatigue showed higher benefit levels compared to those with mild symptoms. The safe and highly feasible 30secSTS correlated well with physical and mental outcomes and better workability in COVID-19 survivors.Implications for rehabilitationPhysical exercising showed to be an effective intervention method in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID syndrome by positively affecting both physical and mental health.In health care workers suffering from post-COVID syndrome, increases in physical performance are directly related to improvements in work ability.The 30\u2009s sit-to-stand test (30secSTS) showed promising results as clinical assessment tool.The results of this study indicate that physical exercising will need to play a large and substantial role over the next years in the rehabilitation of COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID-19-syndrome as it positively affects both physical and mental dimensions of the post-COVID-19-syndrome as well as work ability.",

Fatigue and dyspnea seem to be the most prevalent post-COVID symptoms.\nOBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo analyze whether a tele-rehabilitation exercise program is able to improve self-perceived physical exertion in patients with post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea.\nMETHODS\n\n\nSixty-eight COVID-19 survivors exhibiting post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea derived to four Primary Health Care centers located in Madrid were enrolled in this quasi-experimental study. A tele-rehabilitation program based on patient education, physical activity, airway clearing, and breathing exercise interventions was structured on eighteen sessions (3 sessions/week). Self-perceived physical exertion during daily living activities, dyspnea severity, health-related quality of life and distance walked and changes in oxygen saturation and heart rate during the 6-Minute walking test were assessed at baseline, after the program and at 1- and 3-months follow-up periods.\nRESULTS\n\n\nDaily living activities, dyspnea severity and quality of life improved significantly at all follow-ups (p<0.001). Additionally, a significant increase in oxygen saturation before and after the 6-Minute Walking test was found when compared with baseline (P<0.001). Heart rate adaptations at rest were found during the follow-up periods (P = 0.012). Lower perceived exertion before and after the 6-Minute Walking test were also observed, even if larger distance were walked (P<0.001).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nTele-rehabilitation programs could be an effective strategy to reduce post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea in COVID-19 survivors. In addition, it could also reduce the economic burden of acute COVID-19, reaching a greater number of patients and releasing Intensive Unit Care beds for prioritized patients with a severe disease.\nSTUDY REGISTRATION\n\n\nThe international OSF Registry registration link is https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/T8SYB.",

In fact, it has been proposed that physical exercise may modulate the immune system. However, the potential effect of an exercise program on COVID-19 survivors has not been investigated. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the modifications in immunological parameters, physical condition, inflammatory profile, and perceived persistent symptoms after 6 weeks of supervised resistance training (RT), in addition to the standard care on the clinical status of patients with persistent COVID-19 symptoms. The objective of this protocol is to describe the scientific rationale in detail and to provide information about the study procedures.\nMETHODS/DESIGN\n\n\nA total of 100 patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19 will be randomly allocated into either a group receiving standard care (control group) or a group performing a multicomponent exercise program two times a week over a period of 6 weeks. The main hypothesis is that a 6-week multicomponent exercise program (EXER-COVID Crossover Study) will improve the immunological and inflammatory profile, physical condition, and persistent perceived symptoms (fatigue/tiredness, musculoskeletal pain, and shortness of breath) in patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nOur results will provide insights into the effects of a multicomponent exercise program on immunological parameters, physical condition, inflammatory profile, and persistent perceived symptoms in patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19.

However, studies evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on athletes' exercise activity are limited.\nObjectives\n\n\nThe objectives of this study were: (i) to describe the perceptions of recreational runners and cyclists recovering from COVID-19 on their training activity and general well-being, (ii) to compare device-measured training data in runners and cyclists pre- and post COVID-19, with non-infected controls that had a training interruption.\nMethods\n\n\nParticipants who were recruited via social media completed an online questionnaire (n=61), including demographic, health and COVID-19 descriptive data. In a sub-sample, device-measured training data (heart rate, time, distance and speed, n=27) were obtained from GPS devices for four weeks before infection and on resumption of training. Similar data were collected for the control group (n=9) whose training had been interrupted but by factors excluding COVID-19.\nResults\n\n\nMost participants experienced a mild to moderate illness (91%) that was associated with a training interruption time of two-four weeks. Decreases in heart rate, relative exercise intensity, speed, time and distance were observed during the first week of returning to training for both groups, followed by an increase from Week two onwards.\nDiscussion\n\n\nResults failed to support a 'COVID-19 effect' on exercise activity as reductions in training variables occurred in both the COVID-19 and control groups. A possible explanation for the reductions observed is a deliberate gradual return to training by athletes post-COVID-19.\nConclusion\n\n\nMore research is needed using device-measured training data prior to and post COVID-19 infection to better understand the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the exercise activity of athletes.",

        "a9_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nDisruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could disproportionately affect the health of vulnerable populations, including patients experiencing persistent health conditions (i.e., chronic pain), along with populations living within deprived, lower socioeconomic areas. The current cross-sectional study characterized relationships between neighborhood deprivation and perceived changes in pain-related experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (early-September to mid-October 2020) for adult patients (N\u2009=\u200997) with nonspecific chronic low back pain.\nMETHODS\n\n\nWe collected self-report perceived experiences from participants enrolled in an ongoing pragmatic randomized trial across medical centers within the Salt Lake City, Utah and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitans. The Area Deprivation Index (composite of 17\u2009US Census deprivation metrics) reflected neighborhood deprivation based on participants' zip codes.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAlthough those living in the neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed significantly poorer physical (pain severity, pain interference, physical functioning), mental (depression, anxiety), and social health during the pandemic, there were no significant differences for perceived changes in pain-related experiences (pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality) between levels of neighborhood deprivation since the onset of the pandemic. However, those in neighborhoods with greater deprivation endorsed disproportionately worse perceived changes in pain coping, social support, and mood since the pandemic.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe current findings offer evidence that changes in pain coping during the pandemic may be disproportionately worse for those living in deprived areas. Considering poorer pain coping may contribute to long-term consequences, the current findings suggest the need for further attention and intervention to reduce the negative effect of the pandemic for such vulnerable populations.",

However, carbohydrate restriction may have weight-independent beneficial effects on glycaemic control. This has been difficult to demonstrate because low-carbohydrate diets readily decrease body weight. We hypothesised that carbohydrate restriction enhances the beneficial metabolic effects of weight loss in type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis open-label, parallel RCT included adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA 1c  48-97\u00a0mmol/mol (6.5-11%), BMI >25\u00a0kg/m 2 , eGFR >30\u00a0ml\u00a0min -1  [1.73\u00a0m] -2  and glucose-lowering therapy restricted to metformin or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Participants were randomised by a third party and assigned to 6\u00a0weeks of energy restriction (all foods were provided) aiming at ~6% weight loss with either a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet (CRHP, percentage of total energy intake [E%]: CH30/P30/F40) or a conventional diabetes diet (CD, E%: CH50/P17/F33). Fasting blood samples, continuous glucose monitoring and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to assess glycaemic control, lipid metabolism and intrahepatic fat. Change in HbA 1c  was the primary outcome; changes in circulating and intrahepatic triacylglycerol were secondary outcomes. Data were collected at Copenhagen University Hospital (Bispebjerg and Herlev).\nRESULTS\n\n\nSeventy-two adults (CD 36, CRHP 36, all white, 38 male sex) with type 2 diabetes (mean duration 8\u00a0years, mean HbA 1c  57\u00a0mmol/mol [7.4%]) and mean BMI of 33\u00a0kg/m 2  were enrolled, of which 67 (CD 33, CRHP 34) completed the study. Body weight decreased by 5.8\u00a0kg (5.9%) in both groups after 6\u00a0weeks. Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet further reduced HbA 1c  (mean [95% CI] -1.9 [-3.5, -0.3] mmol/mol [-0.18 (-0.32, -0.03)%], p\u2009=\u20090.018) and diurnal mean glucose (mean [95% CI] -0.8 [-1.2, -0.4] mmol/l, p\u00a0<\u20090.001), stabilised glucose excursions by reducing glucose CV (mean [95% CI] -4.1 [-5.9, -2.2]%, p\u00a0<\u20090.001), and augmented the reductions in fasting triacylglycerol concentration (by mean [95% CI] -18 [-29, -6]%, p\u00a0<\u20090.01) and liver fat content (by mean [95% CI] -26 [-45, 0]%, p\u2009=\u20090.051). However, pancreatic fat content was decreased to a lesser extent by the CRHP than the CD diet (mean [95% CI] 33 [7, 65]%, p\u2009=\u20090.010). Fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA2-IR and cholesterol concentrations (total, LDL and HDL) were reduced significantly and similarly by both diets.\nCONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION\n\n\nModerate carbohydrate restriction for 6\u00a0weeks modestly improved glycaemic control, and decreased circulating and intrahepatic triacylglycerol levels beyond the effects of weight loss itself compared with a CD diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Concurrent differences in protein and fat intakes, and the quality of dietary macronutrients, may have contributed to these results and should be explored in future studies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03814694.\nFUNDING\n\n\nThe study was funded by Arla Foods amba, The Danish Dairy Research Foundation, and Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg Frederiksberg.",

During the course of the disease intensive treatment is often necessary resulting in multiple interventions including administration of insulin. Although dietary intervention is highly recommended, the clinical results of the widely prescribed diets with low fat content and high carbohydrates are disappointing. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the effect of dietary carbohydrate-restriction in conjunction with metformin and liraglutide on metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS\n\n\nForty patients with type 2 diabetes already being treated with two oral anti-diabetic drugs or insulin treatment and who showed deterioration of their glucose metabolism (i.e. HbA1c >7.5), were treated. A carbohydrate-restricted diet and a combination of metformin and liraglutide were instituted, after stopping either insulin or oral anti-diabetic drugs (excluding metformin). After enrollment, the study patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at one, two, three and six months. Primary outcome was glycemic control, measured by HbA1c at six months. Secondary outcomes were body weight, lipid-profile and treatment satisfaction.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThirty-five (88%) participants completed the study. Nearly all participating patients experienced a drop in HbA1c and body weight during the first three months, an effect which was maintained until the end of the study at six months. Seventy-one percent of the patients reached HbA1c values below 7.0%. The range of body weight at enrollment was extreme, reaching 165 kg as the highest initial value. The average weight loss after 6 months was 10%. Most patients were satisfied with this treatment. During the intervention no significant change of lipids was observed. Most patients who were on insulin could maintain the treatment without insulin with far better metabolic control.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nCarbohydrate restriction in conjunction with metformin and liraglutide is an effective treatment option for patients with advanced diabetes who are candidates for instituting insulin or who are in need of intensified insulin treatment.

In the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT) 322 moderately obese participants were randomized for 2 years to one of three diet groups: low-fat, Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate. Differential effects were observed in the sub-group of patients with T2DM at 24 months: participants randomized to the Mediterranean diet, which had the highest intake of dietary fibers and unsaturated to saturated fat ratio, achieved greater significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels. Patients who were randomized to the low-carbohydrate diet, which had the minimal intake of carbohydrates, achieved a significant reduction of hemoglobin A1C. Although improvements were observed in all groups, the low-fat diet was likely to be less beneficial in terms of glycemic control and lipid metabolism. Interpretation of results from different studies on dietary strategies may be complex since there is often no consistency in diet compositions, calorie restriction, intensity of intervention, dietary assessment or extent of adherence in the trial. Nevertheless, it seems that low fat restricted calorie diets are effective for weight loss and are associated with some metabolic benefits; however, some recent trials have shown that low carbohydrate diets are as efficient in inducing weight loss and in some metabolic measures such as serum triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol may be even superior to low fat diets. When addressing the issue of diet quality rather than quantity applying the glycemic index may have some added benefits.

Distraction methods and vapocoolant sprays may be use to modify the parent's perceptions of their child's pain and anxiety, thus encouraging parents to return for the child's next vaccination.\nMETHODS\n\n\nA convenience sample of 68 parents with children ranging in age from 2 to 12 years was selected. The parents and the child were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group, a DVD distraction group, or a vapocoolant spray group. After the child was vaccinated, parents evaluated the child's pain and anxiety.\nRESULTS\n\n\nNo significant difference in the parents' perception of their child's pain or anxiety was found between the two treatment groups compared with the control group. Some parents expressed the desire to be able to choose the type of distraction method their child received rather than having them randomly assigned to a group.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nAlthough quantitative results were not statistically significant in this pilot study, parents commented that the DVD distraction method seemed helpful before and/or after vaccination, but not during vaccination, and parents appreciated the distraction. Parents, however, would prefer to choose the intervention rather than being randomly assigned to a group. The effectiveness of interventions with regard to parental perceptions of pain or anxiety warrants further study.",

Secondary analyses included shorter risk periods and restricted age categories.\nDESIGN\n\n\nSelf-control screening analysis. Children vaccinated from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1999, were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. In group 1, risks of outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient visits during the 14 days after vaccination were compared with the risks of visits in 2 control periods. Significant plausible medically attended events identified in group 1 were then analyzed in group 2, using the same 2 control periods. Medically attended events significant in both groups were considered potentially associated with vaccination and were assessed by medical record review.\nSETTING\n\n\nFive managed care organizations in the United States.\nPARTICIPANTS\n\n\nChildren younger than 18 years who received an influenza vaccination in one of the managed care settings (N = 251 600).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE\n\n\nAmong vaccinated children seen for a medically attended event, the odds of the visit occurring in the 2 weeks after vaccination vs during 1 of the 2 control periods.\nRESULTS\n\n\nStudy participants incurred 1165, 230, and 489 different diagnoses during the 14 days after vaccination according to the outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient data, respectively. Four diagnoses were positively associated with the vaccine in both groups 1 and 2: impetigo, dermatitis, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, and ureteral disorder not otherwise specified. After medical record review, impetigo (9 cases) in children 6 to 23 months old remained significantly associated with vaccination.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThis large screening safety study did not reveal any evidence of important medically attended events associated with pediatric influenza vaccination.",

At enrollment the Shwachman clinical score, Brasfield radiographic score, oxygen saturation (SpO2), anthropometric indices and other variables were recorded. After vaccination the reactions were assessed daily for 7 days. During the RSV season weekly telephone interviews were performed and children with an acute respiratory illness were evaluated and cultured for RSV. Serum was drawn before vaccination, 1 month after vaccination and at the end of the RSV season and tested for antibodies to RSV.\nRESULTS\n\n\nOther than age the baseline measurements at enrollment were similar between groups. The PFP-2 vaccine produced mild local reactions and induced a significant neutralizing antibody response in two-thirds of the vaccinees and a significant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-fusion glycoprotein antibody response in nearly all the PFP-2 vaccinees.

Each child received 2 intramuscular vaccine doses (Focetria [Novartis, Siena, Italy]): dose 1 at enrollment and dose 2 after 4 weeks (28 \u00b1 2 days). Serum samples for antibody measurements were collected immediately before administration of dose 1, before administration of dose 2 (28 \u00b1 2 days after baseline), and 4 weeks later (56 \u00b1 2 days after baseline).

However, there is concern that vaccination may cause exacerbations of asthma.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTo investigate the safety of the inactivated trivalent split-virus influenza vaccine in adults and children with asthma, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 2032 patients with asthma (age range, 3 to 64 years). The order of injection of vaccine and placebo was assigned randomly, with a mean of 22 days between the injections. Each day during the two weeks after each injection, the patients recorded peak expiratory flow rates, symptoms thought to be related to the injection, use of asthma medications, unscheduled health care visits for asthma, and asthma-related absences from school or work. The primary outcome measure was an exacerbation of asthma in the two weeks after the injections.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe frequency of exacerbations of asthma was similar in the two weeks after the influenza vaccination and after placebo injection (28.8 percent and 27.7 percent, respectively; absolute difference, 1.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.4 percent to 3.6 percent). The exacerbation rates were similar in subgroups defined according to age, severity of asthma, and other factors. Among symptoms thought to be associated with the injection, only body aches were more frequent after the vaccine injection than after placebo injection (25.1 percent vs. 20.8 percent, P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe inactivated influenza vaccine is safe to administer to adults and children with asthma, including those with severe asthma.

The parent and the injection nurse assigned fear scores on a scale of 0 to 10 after each injection visit.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAt the time of analysis, children had a median of 49 injection visits (range, 12-88) during a median study period of 81.5 weeks (range, 15-165 weeks). Fifteen children (83%) lost their fear of injections during the study. A fear score of 0 was achieved after a mean of 8.4 visits (SD, 7.4). The more injection visits were missed, the more likely children were to retain fear of injections (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-1.02; P=.05). Age, adverse events, number of injections at each visit, and change of injection personnel were not associated with increased fear.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nOur analysis suggests that most children receiving weekly subcutaneous immunotherapy lose their fear of injections during the treatment course.

Controls were randomly selected at a 3:1 ratio from among the remaining 6,813 screening participants using frequency-matched age and sex groupings.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SAIDs among those >or=65 years of age who had worked for the vermiculite mining company were 2.14 (95% CI, 0.90-5.10) for all SAIDs and 3.23 (95% CI, 1.31-7.96) for RA. In this age group, exposure to asbestos while in the military was also an independent risk factor, resulting in a tripling in risk. Other measures of occupational exposure to vermiculite indicated 54% and 65% increased risk for SAIDs and RA, respectively. Those who had reported frequent contact with vermiculite through various exposure pathways also demonstrated elevated risk for SAIDs and RA. We found increasing risk estimates for SAIDs with increasing numbers of reported vermiculite exposure pathways (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThese preliminary findings support the hypothesis that asbestos exposure is associated with autoimmune disease. Refined measurements of asbestos exposure and SAID status among this cohort will help to further clarify the relationship between these variables.",

        "a8_doc": "Several studies have investigated the causative role of the microbiome in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but changes in the gut microbiome in RA patients during drug treatment have been less well studied. Here, we tracked the longitudinal changes in gut bacteria in 22 RA patients who were randomized into two groups and treated with Huayu-Qiangshen-Tongbi formula (HQT) plus methotrexate (MTX) or leflunomide (LEF) plus MTX. There were differences in the gut microbiome between untreated (at baseline) RA patients and healthy controls, with 37 species being more abundant in the RA patients and 21 species (including  Clostridium celatum ) being less abundant. Regarding the functional analysis, vitamin K2 biosynthesis was associated with RA-enriched bacteria. Additionally, in RA patients, alterations in gut microbial species appeared to be associated with RA-related clinical indicators through changing various gut microbiome functional pathways. The clinical efficacy of the two treatments was further observed to be similar, but the response trends of RA-related clinical indices in the two treatment groups differed. For example, HQT treatment affected the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), while LEF treatment affected the C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Further, 11 species and 9 metabolic pathways significantly changed over time in the HQT group (including  C. celatum , which increased), while only 4 species and 2 metabolic pathways significantly changed over time in the LEF group. In summary, we studied the alterations in the gut microbiome of RA patients being treated with HQT or LEF.

        "a9_doc": "The notion that dietary factors may influence rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been a part of the folklore of the disease, but scientific support for this has been sparse. In a controlled, single-blind trial we tested the effect of fasting for 7-10 d, then consuming an individually adjusted, gluten-free, vegan diet for 3.5 mo, and then consuming an individually adjusted lactovegetarian diet for 9 mo on patients with RA. For all clinical variables and most laboratory variables measured, the 27 patients in the fasting and vegetarian diet groups improved significantly compared with the 26 patients in the control group who followed their usual omnivorous diet throughout the study period. One year after the patients completed the trial, they were reexamined. Compared with baseline, the improvements measured were significantly greater in the vegetarians who previously benefited from the diet (diet responders) than in diet nonresponders and omnivores. The beneficial effect could not be explained by patients' psychologic characteristics, antibody activity against food antigens, or changes in concentrations of prostaglandin and leukotriene precursors. However, the fecal flora differed significantly between samples collected at time points at which there was substantial clinical improvement and time points at which there were no or only minor improvements.

        "a1_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nTo compare the clinical efficacy, as expressed by relapse rate and disability accumulation, and safety profile of glatiramer acetate (Copaxone; COP-1) and Interferon beta-1b (Betaferon; IFN beta - 1b) administered to multiple sclerosis patients during a 2-year follow-up on an open-label parallel design, as compared to their clinical condition in the 2-year period prior to treatment.\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nCopaxone and IFN beta - 1b have been recently introduced for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. Both medications have been proven to have a relatively safe profile and are used extensively world-wide.\nMETHODS\n\n\n58 consecutive patients with relapsing forms of MS were enrolled from the MS out-patient clinic, during three months. After being informed in detail of the two approved treatment options existing at the time in Israel, the patients chose by themselves to receive either: (a) Copaxone 20 mg subcutaneously (sc) daily (Copaxone dly, 20 patients), or (b) Copaxone 20 mg sc alternate-day (Copaxone alt, 18 patients) or (c) IFN beta-1b 8 MIU sc in alternate day (20 patients). Mean relapse rate/year and mean EDSS/year were calculated for each group of patients during the 2 years prior to the onset of treatment, and during the year prior to the onset of treatment. Statistical significance was observed in the relapse rate in the year prior to the onset of treatment between the IFN beta -1b group and the two Copaxone groups (p = 0.05). This statistical difference has no effect on the overall data of the 2 years prior to starting the treatment and on the results. No statistical significance was observed in the total number of relapses, and on the 2-year relapse rate, prior to the onset of treatment. Mean relapse rate/year and mean EDSS/year were calculated for each group during the first and second year of treatment. Wilcoxon analysis for clinical data and chi-square for adverse events were applied.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe three groups were statistically comparable concerning mean relapse/year in the 2 years before the trial started and no statistical significance was observed among the three groups. A statistically significant reduction in the mean relapse rate in the 2 years after onset of treatment was observed in the three group of patients: Copaxone daily (dly) 1.1 +/- 0.6 (p = 0.0001); Copaxone alternate (alt) 0.9 +/- 0.6 (p = 0.0004) and IFN beta -1b 1.2 +/- 0.7 (p = 0.0001). Disability as expressed by EDSS score prior to the onset of treatment and after 2 years of treatment showed deterioration in the three groups although more significant in the Copaxone groups: Copaxone dly 3.3 +/- 1.4 to 3.8 +/- 1.6 (p = 0.007); Copaxone alt 2.4 +/- 1.1 to 2.8 +/- 1.3 (p=0.04); IFN beta - 1b 3.1 +/- 1.3 to 3.3 +/- 2.0 (N.S.). The most common adverse events reported were: (1) flu-like symptoms 7 pts (35%) in the IFN beta -1b group; 10 pts (26%) of the two Copaxone groups; (2) increased spasticity of lower limbs 3 pts (15%), only in the IFN beta -1b group; (3) site injection reaction (SIR): 16 SIR (80%) in the IFN beta -1b group; 12 SIR (67%) in the Copaxone alt group; 14 SIR (70%) in the Copaxone dly group; and (4) systemic reaction 3 pts (15%) in the IFN beta -1b group; 4 pts (22%) in the Copaxone alt group; 6 pts (30%) in the Copaxone dly group. Premature termination occurred in five patients treated with Copaxone (3 in the alternate group and 2 in the daily group).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThe present study, despite the limitations of an open-label study, shows that Copaxone dly, Copaxone alt and IFN beta -1b treatment seem to be equally effective for the control of exacerbations in MS. The adverse event profile, as reported by the patients, was also similar. However, the adverse events profile registered indicated that Copaxone is somewhat less detrimental, whereas disability as measured by EDSS accumulation showed that the interferon beta - 1b patients demonstrated a slower progression of the disability.",

Aggregated beta-amyloid induces microglia to become cytotoxic and block neurogenesis. Recent evidence showed that T cell-based vaccination with Copaxone in AD mice model resulted in modulation of microglia into neuroprotective phenotype and as a result in reduction of cognitive decline, elimination of plaque formation, and induction of neuronal survival and neurogenesis. The aim was to investigate whether the effect of Copaxone on drusen in dry AMD is similar to that on deposits of other age-related chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\nPatients over 50 years of age with intermediate dry AMD in both eyes were randomized to receive Copaxone or sham injections and were weekly treated by subcutaneous injections of Copaxone (dose of 20 mg) or sham injections for 12 weeks. At baseline, 6-week, and 12-week visits, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, fundus examination and photography, fluorescein angiography, and ocular coherent tomography were performed. Main outcome measure was a change in total drusen area (TDA) measured by Image-Pro software and presented in arbitrary units (AU).\nRESULTS\n\n\nEight studied eyes of four treated patients showed a decrease in TDA from 48130 to 16205 AU at 12 weeks as compared to baseline. In contrast, four control eyes (two patients) demonstrated almost no change in TDA (from 32294 to 32781 AU).\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nThese preliminary results show that Copaxone reduces drusen area.",

        "a3_doc": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\nAUD medication treatment has been shown to improve outcomes compared with placebo when confined to per-protocol analysis. The same outcomes, however, have not always been maintained in intent-to-treat analysis, thus suggesting adherence may have a significant impact on efficacy outcomes. There is conflicting evidence present in the literature comparing adherence to oral versus injectable AUD pharmacotherapy and a paucity of information in the veteran population on risk factors for low adherence.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThe primary end point of this retrospective chart review was to determine whether adherence rates differ between oral and injectable AUD treatments in veterans during the first year of treatment (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) using the portion of days covered model. Secondary end points were to determine differing characteristics between patients with high versus low adherence and compare alcohol-related readmission rates and discontinuation rates between groups.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAdherence to injectable extended-release (XR) naltrexone was significantly higher than oral naltrexone at all time points and was significantly higher than disulfiram at 3, 6, and 9 months, but it was not significantly different from acamprosate at any time point. At months 9 and 12, acamprosate had significantly higher adherence compared with oral naltrexone. Patients with higher adherence were seen more frequently in the mental health clinic and had previously tried more AUD medications. The discontinuation rates and alcohol-related admission rates were not significantly different between groups at 1 year.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nXR naltrexone may improve adherence rates compared with oral naltrexone or disulfiram, but not acamprosate based on these outcomes. Patients may have increased adherence if they are seen more often in clinic and have trialed more AUD medications.",

        "a4_doc": "OBJECTIVE\n\n\nThis post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy of galcanezumab for the prevention of migraine in patients with and without comorbid anxiety and/or depression.\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nPatients with migraine have a higher risk of anxiety and/or depression. Given the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and their potential negative prognostic impact, determining the efficacy of migraine treatments in patients with these comorbidities is important.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThe results of 2 phase 3 episodic migraine studies of patients with 4-14 migraine headache days (MHD) per month were pooled. A third chronic migraine study, which was evaluated separately, enrolled patients with \u226515 headache days per month, of which \u22658 had migraine-like features. Patients in all 3 studies were randomized 2:1:1 to placebo, galcanezumab 120\u00a0mg, or galcanezumab 240\u00a0mg. The efficacy of galcanezumab on migraine was measured in subgroups of patients with anxiety and/or depression (current or past) and patients without. A repeated measures model was used to compare treatment groups within each subgroup and to test for consistency of treatment effect across the anxiety/depression subgroups (subgroup-by-treatment interaction) during the double-blind treatment phases.\nRESULTS\n\n\nAmong 1773 intent-to-treat patients with episodic migraine, both doses of galcanezumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements relative to placebo in overall number of MHD for the subgroups of patients with anxiety and/or depression (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -2.07 [-2.81, -1.33] for galcanezumab 120\u00a0mg [P\u00a0<\u00a0.001], -1.91 [-2.78, -1.04] for 240\u00a0mg [P\u00a0<\u00a0.001]) and without anxiety and/or depression (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -1.92 [-2.36, -1.47] for 120\u00a0mg [P\u00a0<\u00a0.001], -1.77 [-2.20, -1.33] for 240\u00a0mg [P\u00a0<\u00a0.001]), as was observed for the secondary outcomes of MHD with acute medication use and functional impairment. Among 1113 intent-to-treat patients with chronic migraine, those with anxiety and/or depression had significant reductions in overall MHD frequency with the 240-mg dose (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -1.92 [-3.52, -0.33]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018), whereas significant reductions were observed at both the 120-mg (mean change difference from placebo [95% CI]: -2.29 [-3.26, -1.31]; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and 240-mg (-1.85 [-2.83, -0.87]; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) doses in patients without anxiety and/or depressions. Significant reductions (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) in MHD with acute medication use were observed at both doses within both anxiety/depression subgroups and for overall functional impairment for patients without anxiety and/or depression, though neither dose significantly reduced overall functional impairment beyond placebo in the subgroup with anxiety and/or depression. In the episodic and chronic migraine studies, the subgroup-by-treatment interaction was not statistically significant for MHD, MHD with acute medication use, or functional impairment (chronic study only), suggesting a lack of evidence of differential effect between subgroups. Furthermore, differences between subgroups in the mean change differences from placebo, as well as overlapping 95% confidence intervals for the subgroups, indicated lack of a clinical or statistical difference between subgroups for these outcome variables. There was a significantly higher percentage of patients with episodic migraine attaining \u226550%, \u226575%, and 100% reductions, and a higher percentage of patients with chronic migraine attaining \u226550% and \u226575% reductions from baseline with galcanezumab compared with placebo, regardless of medical history of anxiety and/or depression.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nA medical history of anxiety and/or depression does not seem to interfere with response to galcanezumab among patients with episodic migraine, and both doses of galcanezumab appear efficacious for these individuals regardless of this psychiatric history. Among patients with chronic migraine and comorbid anxiety and/or depression, the 240-mg dose, but not the 120-mg dose, significantly decreased overall MHD, but neither dose resulted in significantly greater functional improvement. Patients with migraine and comorbid anxiety and/or depression often require additional interventions, and this may be more important in chronic migraine.",

The main outcome measures were change from baseline to endpoint in total STAI-S, Trail-Making Test B (TMT-B) and the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Also changes in the parameters of the pupil's reaction to light stimuli.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThere was no significant difference in any of the primary or secondary outcomes or response and remission rates concerning any analysis (last observation carried-forward of at least visit 2 or completers) between the 2 treatment arms. One additional finding of the current study is that adding pregabalin does not have a significant effect on autonomic function.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThis study does not support the usefulness of adding pregabalin in patients with GAD and UMD and with an early nonresponse to escitalopram (EudraCT Number: 2012-004062-17, Sponsor's Protocol Code Number: WS1702721).",

        "a8_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nCurrent treatment options for the management of depressive episodes in bipolar disorder are often sub-optimal, with some treatments either noted to be only partially effective or to require long durations of treatment prior to a therapeutic response. Therefore, pharmaco-therapeutic options that reduce depressive symptoms in a more rapid manner might provide a viable therapeutic option for some people. Intravenous (IV) scopolamine, a pan muscarinic antagonist, has been demonstrated in a number of studies to confer a rapid antidepressant effect, albeit no study to date has exclusively evaluated its potential therapeutic effect in a cohort consisting solely of individuals with bipolar disorder.\nMETHODS\n\n\nIndividuals with bipolar disorder who are currently experiencing a depressive episode of at least moderate severity will be included in this study. Eligible participants will undergo a screening and placebo-run in visit and will be randomised at visit 3 to the treatment or placebo group. Participants will receive the three blinded infusions over the course of 2 weeks, with two subsequent follow-up visits, 1 and 3 weeks after the last infusion visit. The total duration of the study will be approximately 6 weeks. Patients will continue their regular treatment regime in addition to study medication. Objective and subjective mood questionnaires, cognitive assessments and other psychometric instruments will be administered and recorded.\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the antidepressant effects of IV scopolamine in an exclusively bipolar disorder cohort. Trial findings will contribute to the evidence base regarding the cholinergic hypothesis of mood disorders and specifically might result in an additional safe therapeutic option for the management of depressive episodes in bipolar disorder.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04211961 .\u00a0December 26, 2019.

        "a9_doc": "The aim of this study was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of glatiramer acetate (GA) for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who received active treatment versus those on placebo for approximately 30 months (24-35 months) before receiving GA during a six-year organized, prospective open label study. Entry required two relapses in the previous two years and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-5. Patients (251) were equally randomized to daily subcutaneous GA, 20 mg, or to placebo. After approximately 30 months, 208 patients continued in an open label study: 101 continued on GA and 107 switched from placebo to active drug. Groups were well matched at randomization and entry to the open label study. Patients always on GA showed a steady decline in relapses: a mean of 1.5 per year at entry, a mean of 0.42 over the entire six years (95% CI = 0.34-0.51), a 72% reduction (P = 0.0001). They averaged a relapse every four + years (yearly rate 0.23 in year six) and 26/101 remain relapse free. Patients did less well if on placebo for 30 months, but relapses then declined, and by year six the rates were similar. Of patients always on GA, 69% showed neurological improvement of > or = 1 EDSS steps or remained stable compared with 57% if GA treatment was delayed. Of relapse-free patients always on GA over six years, only three of 26 (11%) were worse by > or = 1 EDSS steps, whereas nine of 21 (43%) in the placebo/active group were worse (P < 0.03). Disability, measured every six months, showed that the group of patients always on GA was relatively stable over the six years, while the group who received placebo for the first two-and-a-half years did significantly less well. Daily injections of GA were well tolerated. This longest ever organized MS treatment trial shows that delaying therapy with GA increases the risk of neurologic disability, reinforcing the rationale for using GA as a first-line treatment early in the course of relapsing-remitting MS.",

        "a10_doc": "BACKGROUND\n\n\nCarbamazepine (CBZ) formed the gold standard drug in trigeminal neuralgia (TN) treatment but faces high therapeutic failure. This defined the need to explore a second line of drug therapy. The study aimed at comparing two alternate drugs i.e. Lamotrigine (LTG) and Pregabalin (PGB), in the management of TN refractory to therapeutic doses of CBZ.\nMETHODS\n\n\nTwenty-two patients with diagnosis of refractory TN were enrolled and randomly allotted into 2 groups of 11 each. Each group was subjected to a crossover analysis using LTG and PGB together with CBZ, for a period of 6\u00a0weeks. Patients maintained a pain diary, the scores of which, along with global evaluation scores, determined the primary outcome. Reevaluation of symptoms after 6\u00a0months was done to assess long term efficacy with study drugs.\nRESULTS\n\n\nBoth LTG and PGB were effective over CBZ alone (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); however, statistically insignificant difference (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) was observed between the two groups using Mann-Whitney tests. Unlike LTG, side effects like nausea, insomnia and concentration loss were minimal with PGB thus exhibiting greater patient compliance. Secondary analysis showed complete relief in 4 patients on PGB (mean dose 240.68\u00a0mg/day) while 6 had partial relief. Three patients on LTG (mean dose 310.90\u00a0mg/day) reported relapse of acute symptoms and required peripheral alcohol blocks.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nPregabalin has potential anti-neuralgia properties comparable to LTG. However, the level of patient's tolerance seen with PGB exceeds that with LTG. 6\u00a0months follow-up records suggest that PGB together with CBZ offers a more reliable pain control than with LTG.",

First-- you'll probably want to get on a calcium supplement. That part I was told. How much calcium I wasn't told, but eventually found out from a pharmacist to go a bit above the recommended for your age/assigned sex at birth. Normally my recommended would be 1000mg, but because of the TT, it's 1200mg. Second-- wait at least 4 hours after taking your thyroid hormone replacement before taking a calcium supplement. Also was told that, also something everyone here probably already knows. Third-- our bodies can only absorb around 500mg of calcium in one go. Fourth-- if you've had a TT, your body will absorb calcium citrate more effectively than calcium carbonate. I learned this literally a month ago from a PCP who doesn't specialize in thyroid health, and I'd love to know why my endocrinologist never told me. Now, all of the above led me to be interested in the Citracal slow release, as it's 1200mg, but released slowly so you can take it once a day and still get all of it. My only issue was that I couldn't find anywhere that said how long it took to fully release. I was worried that if it took too long, it would prevent my levothyroxine from absorbing the next day. I couldn't find the answer online, but finally called their questions line today and found out it's 8 hours. Obviously I'm not a medical provider, I just want more of us to have access to this info, especially since a lot of us have worked with medical providers that don't give us all of the information we need. Also not here to advertise for that brand specifically, I just wanted something convenient enough to take once a day, and figured others might have had the same question!",

Treatment was started on postoperative (PO) day 1 in groups B and C.\nRESULTS\n\n\nFewer patients in groups B and C experienced symptoms when compared with group A (P =.005). Patients in groups B and C had only minor symptoms, whereas 2 patients in group A experienced major symptoms and 6 required intravenous calcium (P <.01).

A randomized prospective study was performed, recruiting 120 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy.

The groups were well matched for age, sex and pathologies. Patients of both A and B groups were divided in two subgroups: those operated on for benign thyroid diseases (A1 and B1) and those operated on for malignancy (A2, B2). Serum calcium assays, performed 24, 48 and 72 hours after surgery, showed mean values of calcemia higher in patients of the B1 and B2 group.

Methods:  The study will be conducted as a two-armed randomized controlled trial including patients scheduled for total thyroidectomy. Patients assigned to the intervention group will receive calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide starting 2 weeks preoperatively. Primary outcome is the postoperative quality of life measured by the ThyPRO-39 and EQ-5D questionnaires. Secondary outcome is the assessment of postoperative biochemical (calcium and PTH levels) and clinical hypocalcemia (symptoms as reported by the patient).  Discussion:  A prophylactic dietary supplementation with calcium and magnesium, which could easily be implemented in the preoperative setting, could potentially help to avoid or reduce hypocalcemia-associated symptoms and improve quality of life.

The present trial compared the effects of oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the recovery of parathyroid function when administered routinely or exclusively to symptomatic patients.\nMETHODS\n\n\nThis prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial analyzed 203 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and developed hypoparathyroidism on postoperative day 1 (POD1) with median age of 41 years and proportion of women of 77.8%. Participants were randomized to group A (calcium and vitamin D supplementation administered only to symptomatic patients) and group B (routine supplementation). The primary outcome was the incidence of protracted hypoparathyroidism in the two groups. Secondary outcomes included risk factors for postoperative protracted hypoparathyroidism and the incidence of symptomatic hypocalcemia.\nRESULTS\n\n\nThe incidence of protracted hypoparathyroidism was not significantly different between group A and group B (11 of 99 vs. 17 of 104, P\u2009=\u20090.280). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) in group B exhibited a better recovery tendency. The incidence of postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia in group B was significantly lower than group A (26.92% vs. 42.42%, P\u2009=\u20090.020). Independent factors predicting protracted hypoparathyroidism included sex, preoperative serum calcium, and POD1 PTH.\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nCalcium and vitamin D supplementation administered exclusively to symptomatic patients achieved the same effect on protracted hypoparathyroidism as routine supplementation. However, routine supplementation significantly reduced postoperative hypocalcemia. Extra attention is necessary in female patients with high preoperative serum calcium and patients with low POD1 PTH.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\n\n\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), ChiCTR1900022194.

Also not here to advertise for that brand specifically, I just wanted something convenient enough to take once a day, and figured others might have had the same question!",
